Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped.

There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down.

380,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew.  Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time.","Whose delight was it to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys?","The spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, but he could not take the shape of a needle, only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole, every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew, the spirit dwelt in the middle of France, among the mountain pastures and valleys, among the cowsheds, the spirit was a mischievous kind of spirit, it was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys, they never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, but he could not take the shape of a needle, only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle, at least he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole, every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew, the spirit dwelt in the middle of France, among the mountain pastures and valleys, among the cowsheds, the spirit was a mischievous kind of spirit, it was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys, they never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare, the spirit dwelt in the middle of France, among the mountain pastures and valleys, among the cowsheds, the spirit was a mischievous kind of spirit, it was this spirit's delight to play tr","[0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07407407407407408, 0.07692307692307691, 0.0909090909090909, 0.0, 0.20000000000000004, 0.0, 0.09523809523809523, 0.15999999999999998, 0.1739130434782609, 0.1, 0.07999999999999999, 0.42857142857142855, 0.6399999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07407407407407408, 0.07692307692307691, 0.0909090909090909, 0.0, 0.20000000000000004, 0.0, 0.09523809523809523, 0.15999999999999998, 0.1739130434782609, 0.1, 0.07999999999999999, 0.42857142857142855, 0.6399999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15999999999999998, 0.1739130434782609, 0.1, 0.07999999999999999, 0.23076923076923078]","[0.8434747, 0.80372953, 0.79213536, 0.8185813, 0.7837471, 0.841632

381,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew.  Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time.",Why didn't everyone know when they were safe from the mischievous kind of spirit?,"The spirit could change himself into a man, woman, or child, a stick, a goat, or a ploughshare, but he could not take the shape of a needle, and he could not imitate the hole, only a needle could fit through it, and he knew this because he could not transform himself into a needle, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not transform himself into a needle, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not transform himself into a needle, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not transform himself into a needle, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and he knew that he could not imitate the hole, and","[0.1739130434782609, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.16, 0.09090909090909091, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.08, 0.0]","[0.8599431, 0.8089857, 0.82782334, 0.7914798, 0.8171756, 0.7965853

384,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew.  Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time.",What did the sprite do in the cowsheds?,"The spirit could change himself into a man, woman, or child, a stick, a goat, or a ploughshare, but he could not take the shape of a needle, and he could not imitate the hole, only a needle, according to the storyt","[0.125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.11111111111111112, 0.13333333333333333, 0.0, 0.16666666666666666]","[0.86214566, 0.8227271, 0.8488295, 0.81589067, 0.84402555, 0.8163529

389,"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load.  'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump.  'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered:  'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.'  In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears. Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear!

448,"He set out, and, as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab-tree branches, into gold.  Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry. The laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed.  Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted.  ""Welcome, Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" cried the company, perceiving their visitor. The word ""Welcome"" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle.  Time flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, ""We're going to ride to Dublin to-night to steal a young lady. Will you come, too, Jamie Freel?""  ""Ay, that I will,"" cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure.  A troop of horses stood at the door. Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air. He was presently flying over his mother's cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop. On and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry Halloween. It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin.  ""This is Derry,"" said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire.

449,"He set out, and, as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab-tree branches, into gold.  Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry. The laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed.  Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted.  ""Welcome, Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" cried the company, perceiving their visitor. The word ""Welcome"" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle.  Time flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, ""We're going to ride to Dublin to-night to steal a young lady. Will you come, too, Jamie Freel?""  ""Ay, that I will,"" cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure.  A troop of horses stood at the door. Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air. He was presently flying over his mother's cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop. On and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry Halloween. It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin.  ""This is Derry,"" said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire. What was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest, till fifty little voices were crying out, ""Derry! Derry!

462,"""Are you mad, Jamie?"" cried his mother in terror. ""Sure they'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year.""  Jamie made light of her fears and went his way.  As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.""  ""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.""  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!""  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.""  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  ""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother.

489,"In like manner was Jamie informed as they passed over each town on the route, and at length he heard the silvery voices cry, ""Dublin! Dublin!""  It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen's Green.  The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed. He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form.  The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before.  They were approaching home. Jamie heard ""Rathmullan,"" ""Milford,"" ""Tamney,"" and then he knew they were near his own house.  ""You've all had your turn at carrying the young lady,"" said he. ""Why wouldn't I get her for a wee piece?""  ""Ay, Jamie,"" replied they pleasantly, ""you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure.""  Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door.  ""Jamie Freel! Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?"" cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door.  Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then again a sack of wool.  But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, ""Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll mak' her deaf and dumb,"" and she threw something over the young girl.",Why was a stick left on the bed?,"What did the elves turn into at one moment?, What did the elf do when she threw something over the young girl?","[0.11764705882352941, 0.09523809523809525]","[0.8827562, 0.89175326]","[0.27148208022117615, 0.3498278260231018]","[0.0752397025358172, 0.07596458453655348]"

491,"These articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony, in which she would some day fill the chief part, and only saw the light occasionally when they were hung out to air. She was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her.  The poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a ""creepie"" in the chimney corner and buried her face in her hands.  ""What'll we do to keep up a lady like you?"" cried the old woman.  ""I'll work for you both, mother,"" replied the son.  ""An' how could a lady live on we'er poor diet?"" she repeated.  ""I'll work for her,"" was all Jamie's answer.  He kept his word. The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening, while the old woman span by the fire and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment acquired by him in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest.  But she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her. By degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.  So a year passed and Halloween came round again.

As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.""  ""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.""  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!""  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.""  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  ""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother.  ""No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!"" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.

741,"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the South of Scotland, near the Border. It was not very far from Longtown. He was known as Canonbie Dick. As he went up and down the country, he almost always had a long string of horses behind him. He bought them at one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big penny by the transaction.  He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. The people who knew him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one else need be asked to do it.

745,"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the South of Scotland, near the Border. It was not very far from Longtown. He was known as Canonbie Dick. As he went up and down the country, he almost always had a long string of horses behind him. He bought them at one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big penny by the transaction.  He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. The people who knew him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one else need be asked to do it.  One evening, he was returning from a fair at some distance from his home with a pair of horses which he had not succeeded in selling. He was riding over Bowden Moor, which lies to the west of the Eildon Hills. These hills are, as all men know, the scene of some of the most famous of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies. Also, so men say, they are the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights, who rest under the three high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them.","Who were resting under the three high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them?","Where did the horse-dealer live?, What was Canonbie Dick known for?, What did Canonbie Dick do with the horses?, Where was Bowden Moor?, What did men say about Bowden Moor?, What did men say about the Eildon Hills?, What did men say about the three high peaks?, What did men say about King Arthur and his Knights?, What did men say about the three high peaks being the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights?, What did men say about the three high peaks being the scene of some of the most famous of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies?, What did men say about the three high peaks waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them?","[0.08695652173913045, 0.08695652173913045, 0.07999999999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07999999999999999, 0.30769230769230765, 0.0, 0.27777777777777773, 0.24390243902439027, 0.7428571428571428]","[0.8544584, 0.82298774, 0.84075135, 0.85466516, 0.8414555, 0.8511166

At last they found themselves in an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast apartment.  And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.  But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them.

He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.  Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.

897,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she  was. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,  'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots  thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he  asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King  could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.    After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature  begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He  answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King  the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little  room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver  as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a  King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her  again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",Why did the Many-furred Creature say she did not know where the ring came from?,"What did the Many-furred Creature do when the cook asked her to cook the King the bread-soup?, What did the Many-furred Creature look like when she went upstairs?","[0.34285714285714286, 0.42857142857142855]","[0.90483344, 0.91294426]","[0.30017971992492676, 0.3027135133743286]","[0.21869766863251183, 0.20915871707586733]"
898,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.  When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time.

899,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white.",Why did the king want to keep the maiden's hand in his?,"Why did the King want to keep the maiden's hands in his?, Why did the maiden not take off the dress?","[0.9230769230769231, 0.3636363636363637]","[0.9895865, 0.9053671]","[0.8676326870918274, 0.3589971661567688]","[0.09303723531853667, 0.09214943980577085]"
