It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed. Indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel.

10,"After some time the linen was taken into the house, and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears. ""See now, then,"" said the flax, ""I have become something of importance. This was my destiny. It is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every one ought to be. It is the only way to be happy.

There she came to a high garden wall, over which hung the branches of trees, loaded with beautiful fruit. Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped. The maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold, and turned to see from which direction she had come, and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back. But the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer, and without thinking of the prince's words, she touched the apple with her foot, and it began to roll again.",Where was the maiden after she followed the apple through the portal?,"What did the princess do after she found the apple?, What did the princess do after she touched the apple with her foot?"
102,"Suddenly the portal closed with a great crash. Then the maiden was much frightened, and regretted having done what had been forbidden her; yet now she could not get out, and was compelled to follow the apple once more. It rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire-place, where stood two kettles of water, one small, the other large. There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down. But she could not stay there. And since she had already disobeyed the order given her, she expected to die, nothing less, and was quite resigned to do so, because she had lost all hope of winning the prince.",What happened when the portal crashed?,Why was the maiden resigned to die?
103,"So she gave the apple another push, and it rolled into a meadow in the middle of the garden, and there lay two little children, asleep, with the hot sun beating straight down upon them.

But she could not stay here either, so again she touched the apple, and it rolled on and before she knew it the girl found herself by the sea-shore. There, under a shady tree lay the prince asleep; while beside him sat the sea-queen. Both rose when the maiden drew near, and the prince looked at her with alarm and tenderness in his flashing eyes. Then he leaped into the sea, and the white foam closed over him. But the sea-queen was enraged and seized the girl, who thought that her last moment had struck, and begged for a merciful death.

The sea-queen saw that the apple-tree was uninjured, again pushed the apple and it rolled on to the little fire-place.

How dared you take the fire from under my kettle and put it under your own?"" The maiden did not know that she had done anything wrong, and said that she did not know why. Then the sea-queen replied: ""The large kettle signified the love between the prince and myself; the small one the love between the prince and you. Since you have taken the fire from under my kettle and laid it under your own, the prince is now violently in love with you, while his love for me is well-nigh extinguished.

Now, priest, speak the blessing!"" While the blessing was spoken the prince became quiet again, and then greeted his parents and the whole court with joy, and before all embraced his wife, who now for the first time ventured to take a good look at him. From then on the prince was like any other human being, and in the end he inherited his father's kingdom, and became a great and world-renowned ruler, beloved by his subjects, and adored by his wife.

The treasures of the whole kingdom would not have sufficed to pay for such a bridal outfit. And none any longer dared envy the lovely maiden, for never had a princess brought a richer bridal dower into the country. Now all went in solemn procession to the church, and the priests stood before the bridal chairs with their books open, and waited for the prince who, according to the sea-queen's word, would not come until the blessing was to be spoken.

363,"They told Arthur how they had sped, and they all took counsel together, and agreed that they must set out on the quest for Mabon the son of Modron, and Gwrhyr, who knew the languages of beasts and of birds, went with them. So they journeyed until they came to the nest of an ousel, and Gwrhyr spoke to her.  'Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall.'  And the ousel answered:  'When I first came here I was a young bird, and there was a smith's anvil in this place. But from that time no work has been done upon it, save that every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof.

Still, there is a race of beasts older than I, and I will guide you to them.'",What did the ousel do after Gwrhyr spoke to it?,"What did the young men do after they decided to go on the quest for Mabon?, Who went on the quest with the young men?, What did the ousel do when it first came to the nest?, What did the ousel do after it came to the nest?"
364,"So the ousel flew before them, till she reached the stag of Redynvre; but when they inquired of the stag whether he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head.  'When first I came hither,' said he, 'the plain was bare save for one oak sapling, which grew up to be an oak with a hundred branches. All that is left of that oak is a withered stump, but never once have I heard of the man you name. Nevertheless, as you are Arthur's men, I will guide you to the place where there is an animal older than I'; and the stag ran before them till he reached the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd. But when they inquired of the owl if he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head.",Who did the ousel ask for help?,"What did the stag of Redynvre do when Arthur's men asked if he knew where Mabon was?, What did the stag of Redynvre do after he reached the plain?, What did the stag of Redynvre do after he reached the oak sapling?, What did the stag of Redynvre do after he reached the oak sapling?, What did the stag of Redynvre do after he reached the oak sapling?, What did the stag of Redynvre do after he reached the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd?"

366,"So they followed the eagle, who flew before them, though so high was he in the sky, it was often hard to mark his flight. At length he stopped above a deep pool in a river.  'Salmon of Llyn Llyw,' he called, 'I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to inquire if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron.' And the salmon answered:  'As much as I know I will tell thee. With every tide I go up the river, till I reach the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found elsewhere. And that you may see that what I say is true let two of you go thither on my shoulders.' So Kai and Gwrhyr went upon the shoulders of the salmon, and were carried under the walls of the prison, from which proceeded the sound of great weeping.",Who knew how to find Madon?,Where did the eagle stop the two boys?
367,"Who is it that thus laments in this house of stone?'  'It is I, Mabon the son of Modron.'  'Will silver or gold bring thy freedom, or only battle and fighting?' asked Gwrhyr again.  'By fighting alone shall I be set free,' said Mabon.",How did Mabon feel while he was trapped in the prison?,What does Mabon want in order to be set free?
368,"Then they sent a messenger to Arthur to tell him that Mabon was found, and he brought all his warriors to the castle of Gloucester and fell fiercely upon it; while Kai and Bedwyr went on the shoulders of the salmon to the gate of the dungeon, and broke it down and carried away Mabon. And he now being free returned home with Arthur.  After this, on a certain day, as Gwythyr was walking across a mountain he heard a grievous cry, and he hastened towards it. In a little valley he saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the anthill, and all the ants were hurrying to and fro, not knowing whither to go. Gwythyr had pity on them, and put out the fire, and in gratitude the ants brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspaddaden Penkawr required of Kilweh. And many of the other marvels were done likewise by Arthur and his knights, and at last it came to the fight with Trwyth the board, to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor that lay between his ears. But hard was the boar to catch, and fiercely did he fight when Arthur's men gave him battle, so that many of them were slain.",What happened after the seven men found Mabon?,"What did Gwythyr do when he heard a grievous cry?, What did the ants do in gratitude?, What did many of the other marvels do?"

370,"Up and down the country went Trwyth the boar, and Arthur followed after him, till they came to the Severn sea. There three knights caught his feet unawares and plunged him into the water, while one snatched the razor from him, and another seized the scissors. But before they laid hold of the comb he had shaken them all off, and neither man nor horse nor dog could reach him till he came to Cornwall, whither Arthur had sworn he should not go. Thither Arthur followed after him with his knights, and if it had been hard to win the razor and the scissors, the struggle for the comb was fiercer still, but at length Arthur prevailed, and the boar was driven into the sea.

'Is your daughter mine now?' asked Kilweh.  'She is yours,' answered Yspaddaden, 'but it is Arthur and none other who has won her for you.

One could not climb up to it from below, nor could one climb down to it from above. And as the youth was walking around the rock, another youth came along and asked him what he was doing there. So the first youth told him that the bird with nine heads had carried off the king's daughter, and had brought her up to his cave. The other chap knew what he had to do.

The princess, however, motioned to the youth to hide, and he did so. When the king's daughter had washed his wound and bandaged it, the bird with nine heads felt so comfortable, that one after another, all his nine heads fell asleep.

But before she did so, she took a long pin from her hair, broke it into two halves and gave him one and kept the other.

The youth took the pearls out of the tortoise-shell, and put them in his pocket. Not long after he reached the sea-shore.

385,"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load.  'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump.

Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.  LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!

408,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a VERY small person.  Lucie ran on, and on.  THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      ""Lily-white and clean, oh!     With little frills between, oh!     Smooth and hot--red rusty spot     Never here be seen, oh!""",What were some things that were found in the grass?,"What was standing on a stone to catch the water?, What did the door lead to?"

Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door.  ""Jamie Freel! Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?"" cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door.  Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then again a sack of wool.  But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, ""Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll mak' her deaf and dumb,"" and she threw something over the young girl.",Why was a stick left on the bed?,"What did the elves turn into at one moment?, What did the elf do when she threw something over the young girl?"
490,"While they rode off, disappointed, Jamie Freel lifted the latch and went in.  ""Jamie man!"" cried his mother, ""you've been away all night. What have they done on you?""  ""Naething bad, mother. I have the very best o' gude luck. Here's a beautiful young lady I hae brought you for company.""  ""Bless us and save us!"" exclaimed his mother. For some minutes she was so astonished she could not think of anything else to say.  Jamie told the story of the night's adventure, ending by saying, ""Surely you wouldna have allowed me to let her gang with them to be lost for ever?""  ""But a lady, Jamie! How can a lady eat we'er (our) poor diet and live in we'er poor way? I ax you that, you foolitch fellow!""  ""Well, mother, sure it's better for her to be over here nor yonder,"" and he pointed in the direction of the castle.  Meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire.  ""Poor crathur, she's quare and handsome! Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,"" said the old woman, gazing at their guest with pity and admiration. ""We maun dress her first. What in the name o' fortune have I fit for the likes of her to wear?""  She went to her press in ""the room"" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget. She then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings, a long snowy garment of fine linen, and a cap, her ""dead dress,"" as she called it.",Why did the widow feel bad for the young girl?,"What did Jamie Freel's mother call the girl?, What did Jamie Freel's mother take out of her press?, What did Jamie Freel's mother call the girl's dress?, How did Jamie Freal's mother feel after her son told her about the girl?, What did the deaf and dumb girl do after she stepped close to the humble turf fire?, Why did Jamie Freal's mother say the girl was quare and handsome?, What did Jamie Freal's mother do after he told his mother the story of the night's adventure?"
491,"These articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony, in which she would some day fill the chief part, and only saw the light occasionally when they were hung out to air. She was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her.  The poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a ""creepie"" in the chimney corner and buried her face in her hands.  ""What'll we do to keep up a lady like you?"" cried the old woman.  ""I'll work for you both, mother,"" replied the son.  ""An' how could a lady live on we'er poor diet?"" she repeated.  ""I'll work for her,"" was all Jamie's answer.  He kept his word. The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening, while the old woman span by the fire and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment acquired by him in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest.  But she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her. By degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.  So a year passed and Halloween came round again. ""Mother,"" said Jamie, taking down his cap, ""I'm off to the old castle to seek my fortune.""",What will Jamie do to seek his fortune?,"What did the young lady do by the fire?, What did Jamie do in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest?"
492,"""Are you mad, Jamie?"" cried his mother in terror. ""Sure they'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year.""  Jamie made light of her fears and went his way.  As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.""  ""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.""  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!""  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.""  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  ""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother.  ""No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!"" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.  The lady began to speak, and her first words were words of thanks to Jamie.  The three inmates of the cabin had so much to say to one another that, long after cock-crow, when the fairy music had quite ceased, they were talking round the fire.",Why did the wee folk treat Jamie kindly even though they disliked him?,"What did the lady do after she drank the liquid?, How did the lady feel after she drank the liquid?, How did the lady feel after she heard Jamie was coming to save her?, What did Jamie do after he heard the lady was in the castle?, How did the lady feel after she heard Jamie was coming to save her?, What did Jamie do after he gave the lady the liquid?, What did the lady do after she drank the liquid?"
493,"""Look in my face, father, and surely you'll remember me.""  ""My daughter is dead and buried. She died a long, long time ago."" The old gentleman's voice changed from anger to sorrow. ""You can go,"" he concluded.  ""Stop, dear father, till you look at this ring on my finger. Look at your name and mine engraved on it.""  ""It certainly is my daughter's ring, but I do not know how you came by it. I fear in no honest way.""  ""Call my mother--she will be sure to know me,"" said the poor girl, who by this time was weeping bitterly.  ""My poor wife is beginning to forget her sorrow. She seldom speaks of her daughter now. Why should I renew her grief by reminding her of her loss?""  But the young lady persevered till at last the mother was sent for.  ""Mother,"" she began, when the old lady came to the door, ""don't you know your daughter?""  ""I have no daughter. My daughter died, and was buried a long, long time ago.""  ""Only look in my face and surely you'll know me.""  The old lady shook her head.  ""You have all forgotten me. But look at this mole on my neck. Surely, mother, you know me now?""  ""Yes, yes,"" said her mother, ""my Gracie had a mole on her neck like that. But then I saw her in the coffin, and saw the lid shut down upon her.""",Why did the lady tell her father to look at the ring on her finger?,"What did the young lady ask the girl's mother to do?, Why did the girl's mother not believe her?"
494,"It became Jamie's turn to speak, and he gave the history of the fairy journey, of the theft of the young lady, of the figure he had seen laid in its place, of her life with his mother in Fannet, of last Halloween, and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantments.  She took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her.  The parents could not make enough of Jamie. They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude.  But an awkward complication arose. The daughter would not let him go without her. ""If Jamie goes, I'll go, too,"" she said. ""He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since. If it had not been for him, dear father and mother, you would never have seen me again. If he goes, I'll go, too.""  This being her resolution, the old gentleman said that Jamie should become his son-in-law. The mother was brought from Fannet in a coach-and-four, and there was a splendid wedding.  They all lived together in the grand Dublin house, and Jamie was heir to untold wealth at his father-in-law's death.",Why did the old gentleman make Jamie his son-in-law?,"Why did the daughter not want to leave Fannet?, What happened because the daughter would not let Jamie go without her?"

As soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi, out of his basket.  'Zengi-mizi,' he said, 'the king seems loth to grant my request for the Mirror--is there not some other thing of equal value for which I might ask?'  And the wasp answered: 'There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa, which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and accomplishes the desires of him who owns it.

But after a little space a faint glimmering of light began to appear, which grew clearer and clearer. At last they found themselves in an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast apartment.  And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.  But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them.

He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.  Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.

When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.' Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come with us and sweep the ashes together.' So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace. There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.  So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty.

893,"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon. Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and round it, barking. The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a wild beast is in there.'

895,"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made  her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the  Many-furred Creature. When she came into the kitchen and was setting  about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her,  'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; I  want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; but be sure that you  do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in  future!' So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the  soup for the King. She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could,  and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room,  and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up.",Why did the cook want to peep at the company upstairs?,"How did the cook treat the girl after she turned into the Many-furred Creature?, What did the Many-furred Creature do after she cooked the soup for the King?"

897,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she  was. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,  'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots  thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he  asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King  could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.    After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature  begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He  answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King  the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little  room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver  as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a  King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her  again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",Why did the Many-furred Creature say she did not know where the ring came from?,"What did the Many-furred Creature do when the cook asked her to cook the King the bread-soup?, What did the Many-furred Creature look like when she went upstairs?"
898,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.  When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it.",Why did the king have the cook sent to him again?,"Why did the cook think the Many-furred Creature was a witch?, What did the Many-furred Creature do when the dance was over?, What did the Many-furred Creature do when the cook was upstairs?, What did the Many-furred Creature do when the cook said she was a witch?, Why did the cook let the Many-furred Creature go up for the usual time?"
899,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white.",Why did the king want to keep the maiden's hand in his?,"Why did the King want to keep the maiden's hands in his?, Why did the maiden not take off the dress?"
