In the meantime the negotiations for the marriage of the younger prince were continued, and the bride selected for him was soon expected to arrive.",Where were the three of the loveliest maidens between the ages of fifteen and seventeen taken to?,"1.

99,100,"Her relatives and the court said farewell to her with many tears, left her before eleven, locked the door on the outside, and took the keys with them to the castle. The wise woman was also there, consoled the people, and assured them that if the maiden only forbore to speak, and did not turn around, she would come out in the morning fresh and blooming. The poor girl prayed and wept until she grew sleepy; but toward twelve o'clock the outer door suddenly opened, and then the door of the drawing-room. She was startled and filled with fear when, her face turned toward the wall, she saw in the great mirror, how a tall, well-built youth entered, from whose garments the water ran in streams to the floor. He shook himself as though freezing, and said ""Uh hu!"" Then he went to the window, and there laid down an unusually large and handsome apple, and hung a bottle in the casement. Next he stepped to the bed, bent over the sleeping girl and looked at her, strode up and down a few times, shaking the water from his clothes and saying ""Uh hu!"" Then he went back to the bed, undressed hurriedly, lay down and fell asleep.",What did the sea-prince do when it turned twelve o'clock?,"1. What was the reason for the girl's tears?

The maiden made no reply and fell asleep. In the morning the prince rose as usual, stepped over to the bed several times and looked at her from its foot; but she did not dare look up, and closed her eyes. He sighed, took his apple; but left the bottle, and went. When the maiden rose she did as he had told her, and in three days' time removed the bandages, and the girls' hands were well and whole.",What did the maiden do when the sea prince told her how to get the other two girls hands back to normal?,"1.

101,102,"Then she took the apple, and when she was outside the door, laid it on the ground, and it rolled and rolled, and she followed it, a long, long way, to a region unknown to her. There she came to a high garden wall, over which hung the branches of trees, loaded with beautiful fruit. Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped. The maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold, and turned to see from which direction she had come, and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back. But the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer, and without thinking of the prince's words, she touched the apple with her foot, and it began to roll again.",Where was the maiden after she followed the apple through the portal?,"1.

102,103,"Suddenly the portal closed with a great crash. Then the maiden was much frightened, and regretted having done what had been forbidden her; yet now she could not get out, and was compelled to follow the apple once more. It rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire-place, where stood two kettles of water, one small, the other large. There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down. But she could not stay there. And since she had already disobeyed the order given her, she expected to die, nothing less, and was quite resigned to do so, because she had lost all hope of winning the prince.",What happened when the portal crashed?,"1.

The maiden felt sorry for the children, and she took her apron and laid it over them to protect them from[ the sun, and only kept the apples she could put in her little basket. But she could not stay here either, so again she touched the apple, and it rolled on and before she knew it the girl found herself by the sea-shore. There, under a shady tree lay the prince asleep; while beside him sat the sea-queen. Both rose when the maiden drew near, and the prince looked at her with alarm and tenderness in his flashing eyes. Then he leaped into the sea, and the white foam closed over him. But the sea-queen was enraged and seized the girl, who thought that her last moment had struck, and begged for a merciful death.

Thereupon the sea-queen gave the apple a push, and it rolled back through the portal to the apple-tree. The sea-queen saw that the apple-tree was uninjured, again pushed the apple and it rolled on to the little fire-place. But when the sea-queen saw the small kettle boiling furiously, while the large one was growing cold, she became very angry, seized the girl's arm savagely and rising to her full height, asked: ""What have you dared do here? How dared you take the fire from under my kettle and put it under your own?"" The maiden did not know that she had done anything wrong, and said that she did not know why. Then the sea-queen replied: ""The large kettle signified the love between the prince and myself; the small one the love between the prince and you. Since you have taken the fire from under my kettle and laid it under your own, the prince is now violently in love with you, while his love for me is well-nigh extinguished.

Now, priest, speak the blessing!"" While the blessing was spoken the prince became quiet again, and then greeted his parents and the whole court with joy, and before all embraced his wife, who now for the first time ventured to take a good look at him.

And none any longer dared envy the lovely maiden, for never had a princess brought a richer bridal dower into the country. Now all went in solemn procession to the church, and the priests stood before the bridal chairs with their books open, and waited for the prince who, according to the sea-queen's word, would not come until the blessing was to be spoken.

Finally the guardian heard of the matter and came to Laotsze together with the servant. Then Laotsze said to his servant: ""You rascally servant. You really should have been dead long ago. I hired you, and since I was poor and could give you no money, I gave you a life-giving talisman to eat. That is how you still happen to be alive. I said to you: 'If you will follow me into the West, the land of Blessed Repose, I will pay you your wages in yellow gold. But you did not wish to do this.'"" And with that he patted his servant's neck. Thereupon the latter opened his mouth, and spat out the life-giving talisman. The magic signs written on it with cinnabar, quite fresh and well-preserved, might still be seen.

Then he adored Laotsze as his master, and the latter taught him the art of eternal life, and left him his teachings, in five thousand words, which the guardian wrote down.

You see, the goose used for to swim across the lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King.

'For if you didn't say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly again,' says Saint Kavin.  ""'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling you.'  ""Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King.  ""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him. He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the poor old King was doatin', you see), and the King had his goose as good as new to distract him as long as he lived. The saint supported him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death--and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! and, by gor, instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him.

211,212,"""Well, whether you be crooked or straight, you will have to let me pass,"" said Per Gynt. He noticed that he was going around in a circle, and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman's cottage. At these words the crooked one moved a little to one side, so that Per Gynt could get into the cottage. When he entered he found it as dark inside as it was out. He stumbled and felt his way along the walls. He wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. But while he was feeling his way about, he once more noticed the something large, and cold and slippery.  ""And who are you now?"" cried Per Gynt.  ""O, I am the big crooked one,"" was the answer. And no matter where he took hold or where he set his foot, he could feel the coils of the crooked one laid around him.  ""This is a poor place to be in,"" thought Per Gynt, ""for this crooked one is outside and inside. I will soon put what is wrong to rights."" He took his firelock, went out again, and felt his way along the crooked one until he came to his head.",Why was the cottage a poor place to be in?,"1.

212,213,"""And who are you really and truly?"" he asked.  ""O, I am the big crooked one of Etnedal,"" said the monster troll. Then Per Gynt did not waste any time, but shot three bullets right through the middle of his head.  ""Shoot again!"" cried the crooked one. But Per Gynt knew better, for had he shot another time, the bullet would have rebounded and hit him. When this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll, and dragged him out of the hut, so that they might make themselves comfortable there.

215,216,"In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting. When he had made his way far into the Fjoll, he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a mountain-top. But when he reached the top of the mountain, the girl had vanished, as well as her flock, and all he saw was a great pack of bears.  ""Never yet have I seen bears run together in packs,"" thought Per Gynt. But when he came nearer, they all disappeared save one alone.

223,224,"Per Gynt once more lit the fire, called his dogs and locked the herdsman's hut. He went on North, toward the hut at Val, in which there were three dairy-maids. After he had covered some distance he saw a fire, as though the whole hut were ablaze. At the same moment he came across a whole pack of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death. When he reached the hut at Val, he found it pitch dark there, and there was no fire to be seen, far or near. But there were four strangers in the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids. They were four mountain trolls, and their names were: Gust i Vore, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjostol Aabakken, and Rolf Eldforkungen. Gust i Vore stood at the door, on guard, and Per Gynt shot at him, but missed, so he ran away.
