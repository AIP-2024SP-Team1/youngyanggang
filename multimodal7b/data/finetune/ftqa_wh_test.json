They were to be taken to the castle, said the wise woman, and to be treated like ladies of the blood royal, and one after another they were to be sent to the little house by the sea-shore; for should one of them find favor in the eyes of the sea-prince, then the commotion and turmoil would surely cease.

        "input": "Down in Fannet, in times gone by, lived Jamie Freel and his mother. Jamie was the widow's sole support. His strong arm worked for her untiringly, and as each Saturday night came round he poured his wages into her lap, thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco.  He was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of. But he had neighbours of whose opinions he was ignorant. Neighbours who lived pretty close to him, whom he had never seen, who are, indeed, rarely seen by mortals, except on May Eves or Halloweens.  An old ruined castle, about a quarter of a mile from his cabin, was said to be the abode of the \"wee folk.\" Every Halloween were the ancient windows lighted up, and passersby saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building, while they heard the music of flutes and pipes.  It was well known that fairy revels took place. Nobody had the courage to intrude on them.

Dublin!\"  It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen's Green.  The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed. He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form.  The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before.  They were approaching home. Jamie heard \"Rathmullan,\" \"Milford,\" \"Tamney,\" and then he knew they were near his own house.  \"You've all had your turn at carrying the young lady,\" said he. \"Why wouldn't I get her for a wee piece?\"  \"Ay, Jamie,\" replied they pleasantly, \"you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure.\"  Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door.  \"Jamie Freel! Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?\" cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door.  Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then again a sack of wool.  But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, \"Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll mak' her deaf and dumb,\" and she threw something over the young girl.",

How can a lady eat we'er (our) poor diet and live in we'er poor way? I ax you that, you foolitch fellow!\"  \"Well, mother, sure it's better for her to be over here nor yonder,\" and he pointed in the direction of the castle.  Meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire.  \"Poor crathur, she's quare and handsome! Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,\" said the old woman, gazing at their guest with pity and admiration. \"We maun dress her first. What in the name o' fortune have I fit for the likes of her to wear?\"  She went to her press in \"the room\" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget. She then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings, a long snowy garment of fine linen, and a cap, her \"dead dress,\" as she called it.",

He kept his word.

It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.

Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, \"That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.\"  \"Ay,\" said the tiny woman, \"an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.\"  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--\"Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!\"  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, \"You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.\"  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  \"You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,\" said his mother.  \"No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!\" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.  The lady began to speak, and her first words were words of thanks to Jamie.

She took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her.  The parents could not make enough of Jamie. They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude.  But an awkward complication arose. The daughter would not let him go without her. \"If Jamie goes, I'll go, too,\" she said. \"He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since.

At last they found themselves in an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast apartment.  And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.  But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them.

He was delighted with his prize, and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home, when suddenly the turtle found its voice, and tremblingly begged for its life. 'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer. Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude.'  Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea.",

They had only one child, a son, who was their pride and joy, and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long, and never felt tired or discontented with their lot. This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up.' But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks, and as he was really very clever in managing a boat, the old people were very seldom anxious about him.",

He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.  Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.  Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old. But when the man spoke, he knew he was not dreaming, though he felt as if he had lost his senses.",

'I am of no use except to have boots  thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he  asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King  could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.    After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature  begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He  answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King  the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little  room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver  as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a  King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her  again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",

        "input": "But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.  When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it.",

        "input": "The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white.",
