It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed. The mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature. Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one. He needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face. As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him. The old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand.",

And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks. Her head became so heavy--she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights. Now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold. \"What is that?\" said she, and looked on all sides. But the old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him. The old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still. But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child. Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black clothes. She said, \"Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child. He goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes!\"",

I am fond of them. I have heard them before. I am Night. I saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!\" \"I will sing them all, all!\" said the mother. \"But do not stop me now--I may overtake him--I may find my child!\" But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears. Then Night said, \"Go to the right, into the dark pine forest.

There stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up. But the poor mother could not see it. She had wept her eyes out. \"Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?\" said she. \"He has not come here yet!\" said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! \"How have you been able to find the way hither?

There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains. There stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name. Each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots. In other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed.

Yet, small as he was, he had a big spirit of his own, and loved dearly to play the master in the lodge. One day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to play with. He meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear ice. When she handed him the ball, his sister cautioned him not to go too far.  He laughed at her, and ran off in high glee, throwing his ball before him and running after it at full speed. He went as fast as his ball. At last his ball flew to a great distance.

She cooked it, and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no more questions as to how he had come by it.  The next morning the little spirit or boy-man set off as he had the day before.  He made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along. High over his head he would toss it, straight up into the air; then far before him.

Immediately the door was closed with a stone, upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with their clubs with great fury. At length they succeeded in making a slight opening. One of the brothers presented his face at this little window, and rolled his eye about at the boy-man in a very threatening way.  The little spirit, who, when he had closed the door, had returned to his meal, which he was quietly eating, took up his bow and arrow which lay by his side, He let fly the shaft, which, striking the man in the head, he fell back.

When she had made the weapons, which, though they were very small, were beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could furnish, she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake.  \"She thinks,\" said the boy-man to himself, \"I can see no further into the water than she. My sister shall learn better.\"  Regardless of her warnings, he on purpose discharged a shaft into the lake. He waded out into the water till he got into its depth, and paddled about for his arrow, so as to call the attention of his sister, and as if to show that he hardily braved her advice.  She hurried to the shore, calling on him to return. But instead of heeding her, he cried out:  \"You of the red fins, come and swallow me!\"  Although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was addressing, she too called out:  \"Don't mind the foolish boy!\"  The boy-man's order seemed to be best attended to, for immediately a monstrous fish came and swallowed him. Before disappearing entirely, catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore, the boy-man hallooed out to her:  \"Me-zush-ke-zin-ance!\"  She wondered what he meant. At last it occurred to her that it must be an old moccasin. She accordingly ran to the lodge, and bringing one, she tied it to a string attached to a tree, and cast it into the water.",

The boy-man laughed in himself, but said nothing, till the fish was fairly caught, when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself in his fish-carriage ashore.  The sister, who was watching all this time, opened wide her eyes as the huge fish came up and up upon the shore. She opened them still more when the fish seemed to speak. She heard from within a voice, saying, \"Make haste and release me from this nasty place.\"  It was her brother's voice, which she was accustomed to obey. She made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish, from which the boy-man presently leaped forth.

And when that was done, they could carry wood and water into the kitchen. Mike by the Stove was quickest at driving his nails into the wall, and pulling them out again, and he had been quick, too, about carrying his wood and water.

Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god-father to pay for the child's christening. All day long he went from one to another; but no one wanted to be the god-father. Toward evening, as he was going home, he met a very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid clothes, and seemed most kind and friendly. She offered to see that the child was christened, if she might be allowed to keep it afterward. The man replied that first he must ask his wife. But when he reached home and asked her she gave him a flat \"no.\" The following day the man set out again; but no one wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay for the christening himself. No matter how hard the man begged, it was all of no avail. When he went home that evening, he again met the lovely lady, who looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as before. The man again told his wife what had happened to him, and added that if he could not find a god-father for his child the following day, they would probably have to let the lady take her, since she seemed to be so kind and friendly. The man then went out for the third time, and found no god-father that day. And so, when he once more met the friendly lady in the evening, he promised to let her have the child, if she would see that it was baptized. The following morning the lady came to the man's hut, and with her two other men. She then took the child and went to church with it, and it was baptized. Then she took it with her, and the little girl remained with her for several years, and her foster-mother was always good and kind to her.",

But in addition he had three sons, who were named Peter, Paul and Esben, who was the youngest. All three hung around at home and would not work, for they had it too easy. They thought themselves too good for anything like work, and nothing was good enough for them. Finally Peter once heard that the king wanted a shepherd for his hares, and he told his father he would apply for the position, as it would just suit him, seeing that he wished to serve no one lower in rank than the king. His father, it is true, was of the opinion that there might be other work that would suit him better, for whoever was to herd hares would have to be quick and spry, and not a sleepy-head. When the hares took to their heels in all directions, it was a dance of another kind than when one skipped about a room. But it was of no use. Peter insisted, and would have his own way, took his knapsack, and shambled down hill. After he had gone a while, he saw an old woman who had got her nose wedged in a tree-stump while chopping wood, and when Peter saw her jerking and pulling away, trying to get out, he burst into loud laughter.",

You need only do as she says.\" And the prince went in, though he was afraid. When he entered the house the giant was not there.

I threw it out again at once, but it may be that you can still smell it.\" When the giant heard this, he had nothing further to say about it.

Then the giant could no longer resist, and at last had to tell her the truth. \"Far, far away, in a lake there lies an island,\" said he, \"and on the island stands a church, and in the church there is a well, and in the well floats a duck, and in the duck there is an egg, and in the egg\"is my heart!\"",

Now the prince again did not know how he was to get hold of it. \"Well, you must call the salmon,\" said the wolf.

'squeeze it again!\" said the wolf, and when the prince did so, the giant cried out far more dolefully, and fearfully and tearfully begged for his life. He would do all the king's son asked him to, said he, if only he would not squeeze his heart in two. \"Tell him to give back their original form to your six brothers, whom he turned to stone, and to their brides, as well; and that then you will spare his life,\" said the wolf, and the prince did so.

Everything passed so quickly; the tree quite forgot to notice itself, there was so much to look at all around. The yard opened on a garden full of flowers; the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the swallows flew about, saying: 'Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;' but it was not the fir-tree they meant.    'Now I shall live,' thought the tree joyfully, stretching out its branches wide; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles. The golden star was still on its highest bough, and it glittered in the bright sunlight. In the yard some of the merry children were playing, who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas.

'Too late! Too late!' thought the old tree. 'If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could. Now all is over and gone.'

But for each report, which was really a sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer's day in the wood, or of a winter's night out there, when the stars were shining; it thought of Christmas Eve, and of Humpty Dumpty, which was the only story it had heard, or could tell, and then the tree had burnt away.    The children played on in the garden, and the youngest had the golden star on his breast, which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life; and now that was past-and the tree had passed away-and the story too, all ended and done with.

Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose  high above his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest  and straightest he could find.    Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; but that was  foolish, for God sees everywhere.    Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard  something rustling in the pea bed.    'I think that must be a sparrow,' he said. 'Ras! Ras!' but no sparrows  flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs. 'Wait! I  will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,' said the gardener.    Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path.    'Forgive me, dear gardener!' he said. 'I wanted to get some fine boats.'    'Well, I will this time,' said the gardener.

Then he took the peas which  were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. Some of the  shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse  had twelve boats. But they should not be boats, they should be large  warships. He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three  schooners. The largest liner was called Hercules, and the smallest  schooner The Flea. Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and  they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the  waves of the ocean.    And now the ships must sail round the world. The great island over there  was Asia; that large stone Africa; the little island America; the small  stones were Polynesia; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was  Europe. The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of  the world. The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the  frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to  Polynesia. But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones  out into the great sea.    Now, there was on the shore of Europe a real boat, father's own, a  beautiful white-painted boat, and Little Lasse got into it. Father and  mother had forbidden this, but Little Lasse forgot.

Ditsch, ratsch, a man is a man, and so Little Lasse manned  the boat.    Now he would row--and he could row, for he had rowed so often on the  step sat home, when the steps pretended to be a boat and father's big  stick an oar. But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars  to be found in the boat. The oars were locked up in the boat-house, and  Little Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty. It is not so easy  as one thinks to row to Asia without oars.    What could Little Lasse do now? The boat was already some distance out  on the sea, and the wind, which blew from land, was driving it still  further out. Lasse was frightened and began to cry. But there was no  one on the shore to hear him. Only a big crow perched alone in the birch  tree; and the gardener's black cat sat under the birch tree, waiting to  catch the crow. Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about  Little Lasse, who was drifting out to sea.",

Now it was too late, he could not get back to land. Perhaps he would  be lost out on the great sea. What should he do?    When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him, he put  his two little hands together and said, 'Good God, do not be angry with  Little Lasse.' And then he went to sleep. For although it was daylight,  old Nukku Matti was sitting on the shores of the 'Land of Nod,' and was  fishing for little children with his long fishing rod. He heard the low  words which Little Lasse said to God, and he immediately drew the boat  to himself and laid Little Lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves.    Then Nukku Matti said to one of the Dreams, 'Play with Little Lasse, so  that he does not feel lonesome.'    It was a little dream-boy, so little, so little, that he was less than  Lasse himself; he had blue eyes and fair hair, a red cap with a silver  band, and white coat with pearls on the collar. He came to Little Lasse  and said, 'Would you like to sail round the world?'    'Yes,' said Lasse in his sleep, 'I should like to.'    'Come, then,' said the dream-boy, 'and let us sail in your pea-shell  boats. You shall sail in Hercules and I shall sail in The Flea.'",

The sun was shining and it was very warm. Tall palm trees grew in long  rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches. Men red as  copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows  at the buffaloes, who turned against them with their sharp horns. An  enormous cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw  itself on to a little llama that was grazing at the foot. Knaps! it was  all over the little llama.",

It was so cold, so cold; the great icebergs glittered  strangely, and the huge whales now lived under the ice, for they could  not make a hole through with their awkward heads.

It was very warm there, as warm as in a hot bath in Finland. Costly  spices grew on the shores: the pepper plant, the cinnamon tree, ginger,  saffron; the coffee plant and the tea plant. Brown people with long ears  and thick lips, and hideously painted faces, hunted a yellow-spotted  tiger among the high bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned on them  and stuck its claws into one of the brown men.

They anchored at the mouth of a great river where the shores were  as green as the greenest velvet. A little distance from the river an  immense desert stretched away. The air was yellow; the sun shone so hot,  so hot as if it would burn the earth to ashes, and the people were as  black as the blackest jet. They rode across the desert on tall camels;  the lions roared with thirst, and the great crocodiles with their grey  lizard heads and sharp white teeth gaped up out of the river.",

They came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly.  There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; at the top sat  the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener's black cat. Not far  away was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; near the house  there was a garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells.  An old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the  cucumbers were ripe. Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw  Little Lasse he wagged his tail. Old Stina was milking the cows in the  farmyard, and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl  on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached.  There was, too, a well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a  long pipe in his mouth; he was going to see if the reapers had cut the  rye. A boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out, 'Little  Lasse! Come home for bread-and-butter!'    'Shall we land here?' asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes  roguishly.    'Come with me, and I shall ask mother to give you some bread-and-butter  and a glass of milk,' said Little Lasse.",

And now Little Lasse saw that the  kitchen door was open, and from within there was heard a low, pleasant  frizzling, like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a  wooden ladle into a hot frying-pan.    'Perhaps we should sail back to Polynesia now?' said the happy  dream-boy.    'No; they are frying pancakes in Europe just now,' said Little Lasse;  and he wanted to jump ashore, but he could not. The dream-boy had tied  him with a chain of flowers, so that he could not move. And now all  the little dreams came about him, thousands and thousands of little  children, and they made a ring around him and sang a little song:              The world is very, very wide,                 Little Lasse, Lasse,            And though you've sailed beyond the tide,            You can never tell how wide            It is on the other side,                 Lasse, Little Lasse.            You have found it cold and hot,                 Little Lasse, Lasse;            But in no land is God not,                 Lasse, Little Lasse.            Many men live there as here,            But they all to God are dear,                 Little Lasse, Lasse.            When His angel is your guide,                 Little Lasse, Lasse,            Then no harm can e'er betide,            Even on the other side                 Where the wild beasts wander.            But tell us now,                 Whene'er you roam,                 Do you not find the best is home            Of all the lands you've looked upon,                 Lasse, Little Lasse?",

He lay there for a long time quite  still, and he still heard the frying-pan frizzling at home of the fire,  the frizzling was very plain, Little Lasse heard it quite near him; and  so he woke up and rubbed his eyes.    There he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep. The wind had  turned, and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with  another while Little Lasse slept, and what Lasse thought was frizzling  in a frying-pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against  the stones on the shore. But he was not altogether wrong, for the clear  blue sea is like a great pan in which God's sun all day makes cakes for  good children.    Little Lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him.  Everything was the same as before; the crow in the birch tree, the cat  on the grass, and the pea-shell fleet on the shore. Some of the ships  had foundered, and some had drifted back to land. Hercules had come back  with its cargo from Asia, The Flea had arrived from Polynesia, and the  other parts of the world were just where they were before.    Little Lasse did not know what to think. He had so often been in that  grotto in the 'Land of Nod' and did not know what tricks dreams can  play.

After them came the youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity. When the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the King.",

And there no harm had been done her, save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand, and the goblins had been kind to her; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be, she felt as though something weighed upon her, and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband. When Andrew learned who her mother and her people were, he saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. So Andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. Then they sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver, and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrew was far wealthier than his brother.",

        "input": "But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth had come from, did not wish to be any poorer than Andrew. He knew that trolls and goblins walk mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he sailed out to the sand banks at that time. And on Christmas Eve he did see a light or fire, but it seemed to be like will-o'-the-wisps fluttering about. When he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible howls, and cold, piercing cries, and there was a smell of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide. Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls on the shore. They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous fist-gloves. In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed. When they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like that of rotting wood, and when they shook themselves they showered sparks about them. When they drew nearer, John Nicholas crawled up into the loft as his brother had done. The goblins dragged a great stone into the hut, and began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile they screamed so that John Nicholas's blood turned to ice in his hiding-place. Then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth in order to make the fire burn again; while the others carried in heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy as lead.",

        "input": "The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother, stuck fast and could move neither in nor out. Then he grew frightened and began to scream; but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut. But when the cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas freed himself, too. Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason, and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the troll in the Northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms and lofts where he happened to be. Before his death, however, his reason returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say. But after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again. They sank, and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands. Andrew's luck held good; no ship made more successful trips than his own; but whenever he came to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed--the goblins went aboard or ashore with their goods--but after a time he had fair winds, whether he happened to want to go to Bergen, or sail home. He had many children, and all of them were bright and vigorous, yet every one of them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand.",
