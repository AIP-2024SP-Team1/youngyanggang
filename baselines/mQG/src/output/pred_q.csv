"THE flax was in full bloom. It had pretty little blue flowers, as delicate as the wings of a moth. The sun shone on it and the showers watered it. This was as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mothers. They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax. ""People say that I look exceedingly well,"" said the flax, ""and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate I am!

"Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots, which was very painful. Then it was laid in water, as if it were to be drowned, and after that placed near a fire, as if it were to be roasted. All this was very shocking. ""We cannot expect to be happy always,"" said the flax. ""By experiencing evil as well as good we become wise."" And certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed. Indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel. ""Whir, whir,"" went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts. ""Well, I have been very happy,"" it thought in the midst of its pain, ""and must be contented with the past."" And contented it remained, till it was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen.

"After some time the linen was taken into the house, and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears. ""See now, then,"" said the flax, ""I have become something of importance. This was my destiny. It is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every one ought to be. It is the only way to be happy.

"Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. ""It must end very soon,"" said the pieces to each other. ""We would gladly have held together a little longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities."" And at length they fell into rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper. ""Well, now, this is a surprise--a glorious surprise too,"" said the paper. ""Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell what fine things I may have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!"" And so it was, for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was remarkable good fortune.

"But the paper did not go on its travels.

"Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned.

They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster.

"The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was soon burning. ""Ugh!"" cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; ""ugh!"" It was certainly not very pleasant to be burned.

"The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little fellow on his lap. He squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine.

"And all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed of this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is astonishingly cunning.

"Once upon a time there was a king who had a three-year old son, and was obliged to go to war against another king. Then, when his ships sailed home again after he had gained a splendid victory, a storm broke out and his whole fleet was near sinking. But the king vowed he would sacrifice to the sea-queen the first male creature that came to meet him when he reached land and entered his capital. Thereby the whole fleet reached the harbor in safety. But the five-year old prince, who had not seen his father for the past two years, and who was delighted with the thunder of the cannon as the ships came in, secretly slipped away from his attendants, and ran to the landing. When the king came ashore he was the first to cast himself into his arms, weeping with joy. The king was frightened when he thought of the sea-queen. He thought that, after all, the prince was only a child, and at any rate he could sacrifice the next person to step up to him after the prince.","['What happened because a storm broke out?', 'What did the king promise to the sea-queen?', 'What did the prince do when he had not seen his father for the past two years?', 'What did the king do when he reached land and entered his capital?']","['How did the prince feel after he had not seen his father for the past two years?', 'How did the king feel when he saw the sea-queen?', 'How did the king feel when he saw his son again?', 'How did the prince feel when he had not seen his father for the past two years?']","['Who had not seen his father for the past two years?', 'Who secretly slipped away from his attendants and ran to the landing?', 'Who did the king promise to the sea-queen?', ""Who was the first to cast himself into the king's arms?""]","['Why was the king frightened when he thought of the sea-queen?', 'Why did the five-year old prince secretly slip away from his attendants?', ""Why was the king the first to cast himself into his son's arms?"", 'Why did the king want to sacrifice the first male creature that came to meet him?']","['Where did the prince secretly slip away to?', 'Where did the king go to fight the sea-queen?', 'Where did the king go to after he gained a splendid victory?', 'Where did the king go when a storm broke out?']","['When did the king plan to sacrifice the sea-queen?', 'When did the king have to go to war?', 'When did the king reach land and entered his capital?', ""When did the king's ships near sinking?""]","['Which prince secretly slipped away from his attendants and ran to the landing?', 'Which king was obliged to go to war against?', 'Which king would sacrifice to the sea-queen?', 'Which king was frightened when he thought of the sea-queen?']"
"But from that time on no one could make a successful sea-trip. The people began to murmur because the king had not kept the promise he had made the sea-queen. But the king and queen never allowed the prince out without a great escort, and he was never permitted to enter a ship, for all his desire to do so. After a few years they gradually forgot the sea-queen, and when the prince was ten years old, a little brother came to join him. Not long after the older of the princes was out walking with his tutor and several other gentlemen. And when they reached the end of the royal gardens by the sea-shore-it was a summer's day, unusually clear-they were suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud, which disappeared as swiftly as it had come. And when it vanished, the prince was no longer there. Nor did he return, to the great sorrow of the king, the queen and the whole country. In the meantime the young prince who was now the sole heir to the crown and kingdom grew up. When he was sixteen, they began to think of finding a wife for him. For the old king and queen wished to see him marry the daughter of some powerful monarch to whom they were allied, before they died. With this in view, letters were written and embassies sent out to the most distant countries.","['What did the young prince do when he was sixteen?', 'What happened because no one could make a successful sea-trip?', 'What did the young prince do when he was ten years old?', 'What happened when the older prince was out walking with his tutor and several other gentlemen?']","['How did the older prince feel when he was suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud?', 'How did the young prince feel when he was suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud?', 'How did the younger prince feel when he was suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud?', 'How did the king and queen feel when the older prince disappeared?']","['Who was now the sole heir to the crown and kingdom?', 'Who did the king and queen want to marry before they died?', 'Who did the king and queen send to the most distant countries?', 'Who did the people begin to murmur about?']","[""Why couldn't anyone make a successful sea-trip?"", 'Why were letters written and embassies sent out to the most distant countries?', 'Why was the young prince the sole heir to the crown and kingdom?', 'Why did the king and queen never allow the prince out without a great escort?']","['Where was the older prince before he disappeared?', 'Where was the older of the princes before he disappeared?', 'Where did the older prince and several other gentlemen stop walking?', 'Where were the letters written and embassies sent out to?']","['When was the older prince sixteen years old?', 'When was the older prince enveloped by a thick cloud?', 'When was the young prince the sole heir to the crown?', 'When was the youngest prince ten years old?']","['Which prince was the sole heir to the crown and kingdom?', 'Which young prince did the king and queen want to marry?', 'Which prince was the sole heir to the crown?', 'Which young prince was the sole heir to the crown?']"
"While these negotiations were being conducted, it began to be said that the sea-shore was haunted. Various people had heard cries, and several who had walked by the sea-shore late in the evening had fallen ill. At length no one ventured to go there. After eleven at night, because a voice kept crying from out at sea: ""First born, first wed!"" And when some one did venture nearer he did so at the risk of his life. At last these complaints came to the king's ear. He called together his council, and it was decided to question a wise woman, who had already foretold many mysterious happenings, which had all taken place exactly as she had said they would. When the wise woman was brought before the king she said it was the prince who had been taken into the sea who was calling, and that they would have to find him a bride, young, beautiful, and belonging to one of the noblest families of the land, and she must be no less than fifteen and no more than seventeen years old.

"When all was finished, and the little house had been arranged with regal splendor, the cries of ""First born, first wed!"" again began to sound from the shore. And it was found necessary, though all were unwilling, to follow the wise woman's counsel, and choose three of the loveliest maidens between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, belonging to the first families of the land. They were to be taken to the castle, said the wise woman, and to be treated like ladies of the blood royal, and one after another they were to be sent to the little house by the sea-shore; for should one of them find favor in the eyes of the sea-prince, then the commotion and turmoil would surely cease.

"Her relatives and the court said farewell to her with many tears, left her before eleven, locked the door on the outside, and took the keys with them to the castle. The wise woman was also there, consoled the people, and assured them that if the maiden only forbore to speak, and did not turn around, she would come out in the morning fresh and blooming. The poor girl prayed and wept until she grew sleepy; but toward twelve o'clock the outer door suddenly opened, and then the door of the drawing-room. She was startled and filled with fear when, her face turned toward the wall, she saw in the great mirror, how a tall, well-built youth entered, from whose garments the water ran in streams to the floor. He shook himself as though freezing, and said ""Uh hu!"" Then he went to the window, and there laid down an unusually large and handsome apple, and hung a bottle in the casement.

"The prince at once replied: ""Take the hands-they are lying under the bed-and the bottle hanging in the window, and pour some of the contents of the bottle on their arms and hands, join them together, bind them up, take away the bandages in three days' time and the hands will have been healed!"" The maiden made no reply and fell asleep. In the morning the prince rose as usual, stepped over to the bed several times and looked at her from its foot; but she did not dare look up, and closed her eyes. He sighed, took his apple; but left the bottle, and went. When the maiden rose she did as he had told her, and in three days' time removed the bandages, and the girls' hands were well and whole.","['What did the maiden do when the prince told her how to get the other two girls hands back to normal?', ""What did the maiden do when the prince told her how to heal the girls' hands?"", 'What did the maiden do when the prince told her how to get the other two girls hands healed?', 'What did the maiden do when the prince told her how to get the hands healed?']","['How did the maiden feel when the prince told her how to get the other two girls hands healed?', ""How did the maiden feel when the prince told her how to get the other two girls' hands healed?"", ""How did the maiden feel after the prince told her how to get the other two girls' hands healed?"", ""How did the maiden feel when the prince told her how to heal the girls' hands?""]","[""Who told the maiden how to get the other two girls' hands back to normal?"", ""Who told the maiden how to get the other girls' hands healed?"", ""Who told the maiden how to heal the girls' hands?"", ""Who told the maiden how to get the girls' hands healed?""]","['Why did the maiden not dare look up?', ""Why did the maiden not respond to the prince's instructions?"", 'Why did the maiden not respond to the prince?', 'Why did the prince sigh and leave the bottle?']","[""Where were the girls' hands?"", 'Where were the hands lying?', ""Where did the girls' hands lie?"", ""Where did the girls' hands lay?""]","['When did the hands have to be healed?', ""When did the girls' hands have been healed?"", ""When did the girls' hands become well and whole?"", 'When did the maiden need to put the contents of the bottle on her hands?']","['Which bottle did the maiden need to fill with the contents of?', ""Which girl's hands were well and whole?"", 'Which girl did the prince tell to take the contents of the bottle to heal?', 'Which girl did the prince tell to take the bottle and fill it with?']"
"Then she took the apple, and when she was outside the door, laid it on the ground, and it rolled and rolled, and she followed it, a long, long way, to a region unknown to her. There she came to a high garden wall, over which hung the branches of trees, loaded with beautiful fruit. Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped. The maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold, and turned to see from which direction she had come, and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back. But the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer, and without thinking of the prince's words, she touched the apple with her foot, and it began to roll again.","['What did the maiden do after she followed the apple through the portal?', 'What did the maiden do when she reached the great portal?', 'What happened when the maiden touched the apple with her foot?', 'What happened when the maiden followed the apple through the portal?']","['How did the maiden feel when she reached the great portal?', 'How did the maiden pass through the portal?', 'How did the maiden feel when she saw the garden?', 'How did the maiden feel when she reached the portal?']","['Who did the maiden meet at the great portal?', 'Who lived in a region unknown to the maiden?', 'Who lived in the region unknown to the maiden?', 'Who did the maiden meet when she reached the portal?']","['Why did the maiden touch the apple with her foot?', 'Why did the maiden follow the apple through the portal?', 'Why did the maiden want to stay in the garden?', 'Why did the maiden follow the apple?']","['Where did the maiden follow the apple to?', 'Where did the maiden find the most magnificent apples?', 'Where did the maiden find the most beautiful fruit?', 'Where did the maiden find the magnificent apples?']","['When did the maiden reach the great portal?', 'When did the maiden reach the portal?', 'When did the maiden reach a great portal?', 'When did the maiden pass through the portal?']","['Which direction did the maiden have to pass on her way back?', 'Which portal opened as the apple rolled up to it?', 'Which direction did the maiden have to pass?', 'Which tree was loaded with the most magnificent apples?']"
"Suddenly the portal closed with a great crash. Then the maiden was much frightened, and regretted having done what had been forbidden her; yet now she could not get out, and was compelled to follow the apple once more. It rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire-place, where stood two kettles of water, one small, the other large. There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down. But she could not stay there. And since she had already disobeyed the order given her, she expected to die, nothing less, and was quite resigned to do so, because she had lost all hope of winning the prince.","['What happened because the maiden disobeyed the order given her?', 'What did the maiden do when she could not get out?', 'What happened when the portal closed with a great crash?', 'What happened because the maiden disobeyed the order?']","['How did the maiden feel when the portal closed with a great crash?', 'How did the maiden feel after the portal closed with a great crash?', 'How did the maiden feel when she could not get out?', 'How did the maiden feel when the portal closed?']","['Who did the maiden thrust the fire under?', 'Who did the maiden think would die because she disobeyed the order?', 'Who did the maiden follow after the portal crashed?', 'Who did the maiden follow after the portal closed?']","['Why was the maiden resigned to die?', 'Why was the maiden frightened when the portal crashed?', 'Why did the maiden disobey the order given to her?', 'Why did the maiden follow the apple once more?']","['Where did the apple stop?', 'Where were the two kettles of water?', 'Where did the apple stop when it rolled far into?', 'Where did the apple stop after it rolled far into?']","['When the portal closed with a great crash?', 'When the apple stopped at the little fire-place?', 'When did the maiden lose hope of winning the prince?', 'When did the maiden reach the beautiful garden?']","['Which kettle did the maiden thrust under the little kettle?', 'Which of the two kettles had water in it?', 'Which of the two kettles of water did the maiden thrust?', 'Which of the two kettles did the maiden thrust under?']"
"So she gave the apple another push, and it rolled into a meadow in the middle of the garden, and there lay two little children, asleep, with the hot sun beating straight down upon them. The maiden felt sorry for the children, and she took her apron and laid it over them to protect them from[ the sun, and only kept the apples she could put in her little basket. But she could not stay here either, so again she touched the apple, and it rolled on and before she knew it the girl found herself by the sea-shore. There, under a shady tree lay the prince asleep; while beside him sat the sea-queen. Both rose when the maiden drew near, and the prince looked at her with alarm and tenderness in his flashing eyes. Then he leaped into the sea, and the white foam closed over him. But the sea-queen was enraged and seized the girl, who thought that her last moment had struck, and begged for a merciful death.

"The maiden confessed her disobedience, and said that she had done so without meaning any harm, whereupon the sea-queen said she would see how she had conducted herself and punish her accordingly. Thereupon the sea-queen gave the apple a push, and it rolled back through the portal to the apple-tree. The sea-queen saw that the apple-tree was uninjured, again pushed the apple and it rolled on to the little fire-place. But when the sea-queen saw the small kettle boiling furiously, while the large one was growing cold, she became very angry, seized the girl's arm savagely and rising to her full height, asked: ""What have you dared do here? How dared you take the fire from under my kettle and put it under your own?"" The maiden did not know that she had done anything wrong, and said that she did not know why. Then the sea-queen replied: ""The large kettle signified the love between the prince and myself; the small one the love between the prince and you.

"In the old days there lived in Kvam a marksman by the name of Per Gynt. He was continually in the mountains, where he shot bear and elk. At that time there were more forests on the Fjoll, and all sorts of beasts dwelt in them. Once, late in the fall, when the cattle had long since been driven down from the mountain pastures, Per Gynt decided to go up on the Fjoll again. With the exception of three dairy-maids, all the herd-folk had already left the mountains. But when Per Gynt reached Hovringalm, where he intended to stay over-night in a herdsman's hut, it already was so dark that he could not see his hand before his eyes. Then the dogs began to bark so violently that he felt quite uneasy. And suddenly his foot struck something. When he took hold of it, it was cold, and large and slippery. Since he felt certain he had not left the path, he could not imagine what it might be; but he sensed that all was not in order.","['What dwelt in the forests on Fjoll?', 'What happened when Per Gynt reached Hovringalm?', 'What did Per Gynt do continually in the mountains?', 'What did Per Gynt intend to do in Hovringalm?']","['How did Per Gynt feel when he reached Hovringalm?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when the dogs began to bark?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when he heard the dogs barking?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when he heard the barking dogs?']","['Who did Per Gynt meet in the mountains?', 'Who lived in Kvam?', 'Who was Per Gynt?', 'Who did Per Gynt meet in the forests?']","['Why did Per Gynt go up the Fjoll again?', 'Why did Per Gynt feel uneasy?', 'Why was Per Gynt continually in the mountains?', 'Why did Per Gynt feel uneasy when the dogs began to bark?']","['Where did Per Gynt live?', 'Where did Per Gynt stay over-night?', 'Where was Per Gynt continually in?', 'Where did Per Gynt intend to stay over-night?']","['When did Per Gynt reach Hovringalm?', 'When did Per Gynt go up on the Fjoll again?', 'When did Per Gynt go up the Fjoll again?', 'When did Per Gynt go up on the Fjoll?']","['Which marksman lived in Kvam?', 'Which beast dwelt in the forests?', 'Which man was Per Gynt?', 'Which beast dwelt in the more forests?']"

"""Well, whether you be crooked or straight, you will have to let me pass,"" said Per Gynt. He noticed that he was going around in a circle, and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman's cottage. At these words the crooked one moved a little to one side, so that Per Gynt could get into the cottage. When he entered he found it as dark inside as it was out. He stumbled and felt his way along the walls. He wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. But while he was feeling his way about, he once more noticed the something large, and cold and slippery.  ""And who are you now?"" cried Per Gynt.  ""O, I am the big crooked one,"" was the answer.

"""And who are you really and truly?"" he asked.  ""O, I am the big crooked one of Etnedal,"" said the monster troll. Then Per Gynt did not waste any time, but shot three bullets right through the middle of his head.  ""Shoot again!"" cried the crooked one. But Per Gynt knew better, for had he shot another time, the bullet would have rebounded and hit him. When this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll, and dragged him out of the hut, so that they might make themselves comfortable there.

"In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting. When he had made his way far into the Fjoll, he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a mountain-top. But when he reached the top of the mountain, the girl had vanished, as well as her flock, and all he saw was a great pack of bears.  ""Never yet have I seen bears run together in packs,"" thought Per Gynt. But when he came nearer, they all disappeared save one alone.

"""Here is my smeller, so take a good look!"" said he.  ""Here is a taste of the soup that I cook!"" said Per Gynt, and he poured the whole kettleful of soup over his nose. The troll rushed off lamenting loudly. From all the heights around came laughter and derision and calls of:  ""Gyri Soupsmeller, Gyri Soupsmeller!""  Thereupon all was quiet for a time. Before very long the noise and tumult outside began again. Per Gynt looked out, and saw a wagon drawn by bears. The great troll was loaded upon it, and off they went with him up the Fjoll. Suddenly a pail of water was poured down through the chimney, smothering the fire, and Per Gynt sat in the dark. Then laughter and jibes came from every corner, and one voice said: ""Now Per Gynt will be no better off than the dairy-maids in the hut at Val!""","['What did the troll do after Per Gynt poured soup on his nose?', 'What happened after Per Gynt poured soup on his nose?', 'What happened after Per Gynt poured soup over his nose?', 'What was the cause of the noise and tumult outside?']","['How did Per Gynt feel when he sat in the dark?', 'How did the troll feel after Per Gynt poured soup on his nose?', 'How did Per Gynt feel after he saw the wagon drawn by bears?', ""How did Per Gynt feel after he saw the troll's smeller?""]","[""Who was loaded upon the great troll's wagon?"", 'Who will Per Gynt be no better off than?', 'Who did Per Gynt meet on the way back?', 'Who did Per Gynt meet on the way home?']","['Why was Per Gynt sitting in the dark?', 'Why was there noise and tumult outside?', 'Why did Per Gynt pour soup on his nose?', 'Why was there a wagon drawn by bears?']","['Where did Per Gynt sit in the dark?', 'Where did the troll take Per Gynt?', 'Where did Per Gynt go with the troll?', 'Where did Per Gynt and the troll go?']","['When will Per Gynt be no better off than the dairy maids in the hut at Val?', 'When did Per Gynt sit in the dark?', 'When did the noise and tumult outside begin again?', 'When did Per Gynt see the wagon drawn by bears?']","['Which troll took Per Gynt up the Fjoll?', 'Which troll did Per Gynt meet on the way to the hut?', 'Which troll did Per Gynt meet on his way to the hut?', 'Which troll did Per Gynt meet on the way back?']"
"Per Gynt once more lit the fire, called his dogs and locked the herdsman's hut. He went on North, toward the hut at Val, in which there were three dairy-maids. After he had covered some distance he saw a fire, as though the whole hut were ablaze. At the same moment he came across a whole pack of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death. When he reached the hut at Val, he found it pitch dark there, and there was no fire to be seen, far or near. But there were four strangers in the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids. They were four mountain trolls, and their names were: Gust i Vore, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjostol Aabakken, and Rolf Eldforkungen. Gust i Vore stood at the door, on guard, and Per Gynt shot at him, but missed, so he ran away. When Per Gynt entered the room the dairy-maids were well-nigh frightened to death; but when the trolls saw who had come they began to wail, and told Eldforkungen to make a fire. At the same moment the dogs sprang upon Kjostol Aabakken, and threw him head over heels into the hearth, so that the ashes and sparks flew about.","['What happened when Per Gynt entered the hut?', 'What did Per Gynt see after he had covered some distance?', 'What happened when Per Gynt shot at Gust i Vore?', 'What did the trolls do when they saw Per Gynt?']","['How were the four strangers frightening the dairy maids?', 'How did Per Gynt kill the wolves?', 'How did the trolls feel when they saw Per Gynt?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when he saw the fire?']","['Who were frightening the dairy maids?', 'Who were the four strangers in the hut?', 'Who did Per Gynt come across?', 'Who did Per Gynt see when he covered some distance?']","['Why were the four strangers frightening the dairy maids?', 'Why did Per Gynt run away?', 'Why was it pitch dark in the hut?', 'Why did the cows begin to wail?']","['Where did Per Gynt go after he lit the fire?', 'Where did Per Gynt go after he saw a fire?', 'Where did Per Gynt go to after he saw a fire?', 'Where were the three dairy maids?']","['When did Per Gynt come across a whole pack of wolves?', 'When did Per Gynt reach the hut at Val?', 'When Per Gynt entered the room the dairy maids were frightened to death?', 'When Per Gynt reached the hut at Val?']","['Which stranger were frightening the dairy maids?', 'Which of the four trolls tried to attack Per Gynt?', 'Which hut did Per Gynt go to?', 'Which one of the four trolls shot at Per Gynt?']"
"""Have you seen my snakes, Per Gynt?"" asked Tron Valfjeldet--for that was what he called the wolves.  ""Yes, and now you shall travel the same road your snakes have gone!"" cried Per Gynt, and shot him. Then he made an end of Aabakken with the butt-end of his firelock; but Eldforkungen had fled through the chimney. After Per Gynt had done this, he accompanied the dairy-maids back to their village, for they did not venture to stay in the hut any longer.  When Christmas came, Per Gynt once more got under way. He had heard of a farmstead at Dovre, where so many trolls were accustomed to congregate on Christmas Eve. The people who lived there had to flee, and find places to stay at other farms. This farmstead Per Gynt decided to hunt up. He thought he would like to see these trolls. He put on torn clothing, and took with him a tame bear which belonged to him, together with an awl, some pitch and some wire. When he had reached the farmstead, he went into the house and asked for shelter.","['What did Tron Valfjeldet call the wolves?', 'What did Per Gynt take with him to the farmstead?', 'What did Per Gynt do after he saw Eldforkungen?', 'What did Tron Valfjeldet call his snakes?']","['How did Tron Valfjeldet kill Aabakken?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when he saw Eldforkungen?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when he saw Eldforkungen flee through the chimney?', 'How did Tron Valfjeldet feel when he saw Per Gynt again?']","['Who did Tron Valfjeldet call the wolves?', 'Who did Per Gynt want to see on Christmas eve?', 'Who did Per Gynt meet on his way to Dovre?', 'Who did Per Gynt meet on the way to Dovre?']","['Why did Tron Valfjeldet call his wolves the wolves?', 'Why did Per Gynt go to the farmstead at Dovre?', 'Why did Per Gynt want to go to Dovre?', 'Why did the dairy-maids return to their village?']","['Where did many trolls congregate on Christmas eve?', 'Where did Per Gynt want to go to on Christmas eve?', 'Where did Per Gynt go to see the trolls on Christmas eve?', 'Where did the trolls congregate on Christmas eve?']","['When did many trolls congregate on Christmas eve?', 'When Per Gynt reached the farmstead?', 'When Christmas came, Per Gynt once more got under way?', 'When Per Gynt reached the farmstead at Dovre?']","['Which farmstead did Per Gynt want to hunt up?', 'Which troll was accustomed to congregate on Christmas eve?', 'Which animal did Tron Valfjeldet call the wolves?', 'Which animal did Per Gynt take with him to the farmstead?']"
"""May God aid us!"" cried the man. ""We cannot shelter you, and have to leave the house ourselves, because the place is alive with trolls every Christmas Eve!""  But Per Gynt thought he could manage to clear the house of the trolls. So they told him to stay, and gave him a pig's skin into the bargain. Then the bear lay down behind the hearth, Per took out his awl, his pitch and his wire, and set out to make a single large shoe out of the pig's skin. And he drew a thick rope through it for a lace, so that he could lace the whole shoe together, and besides he had two wagon-spokes for wedges at hand. Suddenly the trolls came along with fiddles and fiddlers, and some of them danced, and others ate of the Christmas dinner that stood on the table, and some fried bacon, and others fried frogs and toads and disgusting things of that kind--the Christmas dinner they had brought along themselves. In the meantime some of them noticed the shoe Per Gynt had made. Since it was evidently intended for a large foot, all the trolls wanted to try it on. When every one of them had thrust in his foot, Per Gynt laced it, forced in a wedge, and then drew the lace so taut that every last one of them was caught and held in the shoe. But now the bear thrust forth his nose, and sniffed the roast.","['What happened after the trolls put their feet in the shoe?', ""What did Per Gynt do with the pig's skin?"", 'What did the trolls do while Per Gynt made the shoe?', 'What did Per Gynt do with his awl, pitch, and wire?']","['How did the trolls feel when they put their feet in the shoe?', ""How did Per Gynt make a shoe out of the pig's skin?"", 'How did the trolls feel when they saw the shoe?', 'How will Per Gynt clear the house of trolls?']","['Who came along with fiddles and fiddlers?', 'Who noticed the shoe Per Gynt had made?', 'Who wanted to try on the shoe?', 'Who had two wagon-spokes for wedges?']","[""Why couldn't the man shelter Per Gynt?"", 'Why did the trolls want to try on the shoe?', 'Why did the man have to leave the house?', 'Why did the man tell Per Gynt to stay?']","['Where did Per Gynt go to make a shoe?', 'Where did the trolls come along with their Christmas dinner?', 'Where did Per Gynt set to make a shoe?', 'Where did the trolls come from?']","['When the trolls came along with fiddles and fiddlers?', 'When did the trolls put their feet in the shoe?', 'When did the trolls want to try on the shoe?', 'When was Per Gynt able to make a shoe?']","['Which troll came along with fiddles and fiddlers?', 'Which one of the trolls put his foot in the shoe?', 'Which animal did Per Gynt make a shoe out of?', 'Which troll put his foot in the shoe?']"
"""Would you like to have some cake, little white cat?"" said one of the trolls, and threw a burning hot, roasted frog into the bear's jaws.  ""Thump them, Master Bruin!"" cried Per Gynt. And the bear grew so angry that he rushed on the trolls, raining blows on every side and scratching them. And Per Gynt hewed into the crowd with his other wagon-spoke as though he meant to break their skulls. Then the trolls had to make themselves scarce, but Per Gynt remained, and feasted on the Christmas fare all of Christmas week, while for many a long year no more was heard of the trolls.","['What did Per Gynt do after the trolls left?', ""What did one of the trolls throw into the bear's jaws?"", 'What did the bear do when he saw the trolls?', 'What happened after the trolls had to make themselves scarce?']","['How did the bear feel when he saw the trolls fight Per Gynt?', 'How did Per Gynt feel when the trolls tried to trick him?', 'How did the bear feel after the trolls tried to trick him?', 'How did Per Gynt feel after the trolls made themselves scarce?']","['Who did Per Gynt stay with all of Christmas week?', 'Who did Per Gynt go to for help?', ""Who did the trolls throw into the bear's jaws?"", 'Who did Per Gynt call for to thump?']","['Why did Per Gynt stay?', 'Why did Per Gynt want to thump the trolls?', 'Why did the trolls have to make themselves scarce?', 'Why did the bear attack the trolls?']","['Where did Per Gynt go after the trolls left?', 'Where did Per Gynt stay?', 'Where did Per Gynt go to after the trolls left?', 'Where did Per Gynt and the trolls go to eat?']","['When did Per Gynt return?', 'When did the trolls have to make themselves scarce?', 'When did Per Gynt want to beat the trolls?', 'When was it heard of the trolls again?']","[""Which troll threw a frog into the bear's jaws?"", 'Which troll did Per Gynt go to for Christmas dinner?', 'Which troll did Per Gynt go to for some cake?', 'Which wagon did Per Gynt use to attack the trolls?']"
"ONCE upon a time there was a peasant who had a wheat-field, which was trampled down every Saturday night. Now the peasant had three sons, and he told each one of them to spend a Saturday night in the field, and to watch and see who trampled it down. The oldest was to make the first trial. So he lay down by the upper ridge of the field, and after he had lain there a while he fell asleep.

"Now it was the turn of John by the Ashes. He did not lie down by the upper ridge of the field; but lower down, and stayed awake. After he had lain there a while, three doves came flying along. They settled in the field, and that very moment shook off all their feathers, and turned into the most beautiful maidens one might wish to see. They danced with each other over the whole field; and while they did so, the young fellow gathered up all their feathers. Toward morning they wanted to put on their feathers again, but could not find them anywhere.

"Finally, they discovered the young fellow, and begged him to give them back their feathers. ""But why do you dance in our wheat-field?"" said the young fellow. ""Alas, it is not our fault,"" said the maidens. ""The troll who has enchanted us sends us here every Saturday night to trample the field. But now give us our feathers, for morning is near."" And they begged for them in the sweetest way. ""I do not know about that,"" said the young fellow, ""you have trampled down the field so very badly; perhaps""if I might choose and have one of you?"" ""That would please us,"" returned the maidens, ""but it would not be possible; for three trolls guard us, one with three, one with six and one with nine heads, and they kill all who come to the mountain."" But the young fellow said that one of them pleased him so very much that he would make the attempt, in spite of what they had told him. So he chose the middle one, for she seemed the most beautiful to him, and she gave him a ring and put it on his finger. And then the maidens at once put on their garments of dove feathers, and flew back across forest and hill.","['What did the maidens do when they discovered the young fellow?', 'What did the maidens do after they put on their feathers?', 'What did the middle maiden give the young fellow?', 'What did the maidens do every Saturday night?']","['How did the maidens feel when the young fellow did not give them their feathers?', 'How will the maidens feel when the young fellow does not give them their feathers?', 'How did the maidens feel after the young fellow did not give them their feathers?', 'How will the maidens feel when the young fellow does not give them their feathers back?']","['Who guards the maidens?', 'Who sent the maidens to the wheat-field?', 'Who guarded the maidens?', 'Who has enchanted the maidens?']","[""Why didn't the maidens want to dance in the wheat-field?"", 'Why did the maidens trample the field?', ""Why couldn't the maidens have one of the young fellow?"", 'Why did the maidens put on their feathers?']","['Where did the maidens dance every Saturday night?', 'Where did the maidens dance?', 'Where did the maidens trample the field?', 'Where did the maidens go every Saturday night?']","['When did the maidens come to the young fellow?', 'When were the maidens sent to the wheat-field?', 'When did the maidens go back to the castle?', 'When will the maidens return home?']","['Which of the maidens did the young fellow choose?', 'Which of the maidens did the young fellow want to marry?', 'Which of the maidens wanted to marry the young fellow?', 'Which maiden gave the young fellow a ring?']"

""O John, John by the Ashes!"" said his brothers, and laughed at him. ""Well, it makes no difference, even though I am worthless,"" said John by the Ashes. ""I must try my luck."" So the young fellow set out to wander to the place where the maidens lived. They had told him it was farther south than south, and farther north than north, in the great hill of gold.

"The young fellow said it was not worth quarreling about such things, and that he had better shoes and better canes at home. ""You cannot say that,"" returned the brothers, ""for whoever has these shoes on can cover a thousand miles in a single step, and whatever is touched with this cane must die at once."" The young fellow went on to ask whether they would sell the things. They said that they ought to get a great deal for them. ""But what you say of them is not true at all,"" the young fellow replied.

"A little later he met an old man, and him he asked whether he knew where the place might be that was ""farther south than south, and farther north than north, and in the great hill of gold."" The man said yes, he knew well enough, but it would not do the young fellow much good to get there, for the troll who lived there killed every one. ""O, I have to make the attempt, whether it lead to life or death,"" said the young fellow, for he was fonder than fond of the middle one of the three maidens. So he learned the way from the old man, and finally reached the hill. There he had to pass through three rooms, before he came into the hall to the maidens. And there were locks on every door, and at each stood a watchman. ""Where do you want to go?"" asked the first watchman. ""In to the maidens,"" said the young fellow. ""In you may go, but you""ll not get out again,"" said the watchman, ""for now the troll will be along before long.""

""And yet I will make the attempt,"" said the young fellow, and this watchman also let him pass. Then he reached the inner chamber where the maidens sat. They were so beautiful and distinguished, and the room was so full of gold and silver, that the young fellow never could have imagined anything like it. Then he showed the ring, and asked whether the maidens recognized it. Indeed they did recognize him and the ring. ""But you poor unfortunate, this is the end of us and of you!"" said they.

"The troll came that very moment and thrust his three heads into the door. ""Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!"" said he. The young fellow struck at the heads with his bamboo cane, and the troll was dead in a minute. So they carried out the body and hid it. A little later the troll with six heads came home. ""Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!"" said he. 'some one must have crept into the place! But what has become of the other troll?"" said he, when he did not see the troll with three heads. ""He has not yet come home,"" said the maidens. ""He must have come home,"" said the troll. ""Perhaps he has gone to look for the fellow who crept in here."" At that moment the young fellow struck all six of his heads with his bamboo cane, and the troll at once fell dead to the ground. Then they dragged out the corpse.","['What happened when the young fellow struck all six of the trolls with his bamboo cane?', 'What did the maidens do when they saw the troll with six heads?', 'What happened when the young fellow struck the trolls with his bamboo cane?', 'What did the troll with six heads do when he came home?']","['How did the young fellow defeat the trolls?', ""How did the maidens feel when they found the troll's corpse?"", 'How did the troll feel when he saw the young fellow?', ""How did the troll feel when he saw the young fellow's strength?""]","['Who did the maidens believe crept into the place?', 'Who came home with six heads?', 'Who did the young fellow find in the stable?', 'Who did the maidens find?']","[""Why didn't the young fellow see the troll with six heads?"", ""Why didn't the maidens see the troll with three heads?"", 'Why did the maidens carry out the body and hide it?', 'Why did the young fellow strike the troll with his bamboo cane?']","['Where did the maidens carry the corpse to?', 'Where did the maidens hide the corpse?', 'Where did the troll with six heads go?', 'Where did the troll with six heads come home?']","['When did the troll come home?', 'When did the troll with six heads arrive?', 'When did the young fellow defeat the trolls?', 'When did the other troll return home?']","['Which troll with six heads came home?', 'Which one of the trolls had six heads?', 'Which troll did the young fellow defeat with bamboo cane?', 'Which troll did the maidens believe crept into the place?']"

At that moment, the young fellow sprang from behind the door, and struck one head after another with his bamboo cane. But he had no more than reached the eighth than it seemed to him that the troll was getting the upper hand, and he ran out of the door. The troll was so furious that he came near bursting.

"The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country. He was old and monstrous big; he was wise and friendly to all who knew him. His body was thickly covered with long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun. His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed.  The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; but the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour.  Often his subjects, the polar bears, came to him for advice when ill or in trouble; but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds, lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger.","[""What were the King of the Polar Bears's claws like?"", 'What did the seals do when the King of the Polar Bears drew near?', 'What did the King of the Polar Bears look like?', 'What did the King of the Polar Bears do because the seals were afraid?']","['How was the King of the Polar Bears different from the other polar bears?', 'How did the seals feel when the King of the Polar Bears drew near?', 'How did the King of the Polar Bears walk safely over the smooth ice?', 'How did the King of the Polar Bears look?']","['Who lived among the icebergs in the far north country?', 'Who was wise and friendly to all who knew him?', 'Who came to the King of the Polar Bears for advice when ill or in trouble?', ""Who were the King of the Polar Bears's subjects?""]","['Why did the seals try to avoid the King of the Polar Bears?', ""Why did the seals wisely keep away from the King of the Polar Bears's hunting grounds?"", 'Why did the gulls love the King of the Polar Bears?', 'Why were the seals afraid when the King of the Polar Bears drew near?']","['Where did the King of the Polar Bears live?', 'Where did the king of the Polar Bears live?', ""Where was the King of the Polar Bears's hunting grounds?"", 'Where was the King of the Polar Bears live?']","['When did the King of the Polar Bears live?', 'When would the King of the Polar Bears return home?', 'When did the seals try to avoid the King of the Polar Bears?', 'When was the King of the Polar Bears old and monstrous big?']","['Which of the polar bears came to the King of the Polar Bears for advice?', 'Which animal did the King of the Polar Bears live with?', 'Which animal was wise and friendly to all who knew him?', 'Which animal did the King of the Polar Bears prefer to hunt?']"

And the new queen was very pleased, and sent messengers to fetch the boy, and in his father's court he stayed, while the years went by till one day the queen told him that a prophecy had foretold that he was to win for his wife Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.","[""What did the new queen do when she heard about the king's son?"", 'What did the king see growing near the place where the queen lay buried?', ""What did the new queen do after she heard about the king's son?"", 'What did the new queen tell the king when she heard about his son?']","[""How did the new queen hear about the king's son?"", ""How did the new queen feel when she heard about the king's son?"", ""How did the new queen find out about the king's son?"", ""How did the new queen feel when she found out about the king's son?""]","[""Who did the new queen hear about the king's son?"", 'Who foretold that the king would marry Olwen?', ""Who did the new queen tell about the king's son?"", ""Who did the new queen find out about the king's son?""]","[""Why did the new queen hear about the king's son from an old woman?"", 'Why did the new queen send messengers to fetch the boy?', ""Why didn't the king tell the new queen about his son?"", 'Why did the king decide to take a wife?']","['Where did the king find two bloons on a briar?', 'Where did the king ride past?', 'Where did the new queen send messengers to fetch the boy?', ""Where did the king stay in his father's court?""]","[""When did the new queen hear about the king's son?"", 'When did the king decide it was time to marry?', ""When did the new queen hear of the king's son?"", ""When did the new queen learn about the king's son?""]","['Which prophecy foretold that the king was to win for his wife Olwen?', 'Which queen told the king that a prophecy had foretold?', ""Which queen heard about the king's son?"", 'Which queen did the king want to marry?']"
"When he heard this Kilweh felt proud and happy. Surely he must be a man now, he thought, or there would be no talk of a wife for him, and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride, and what she would be like when he beheld her.  'What troubles you, my son?' asked his father at last, when Kilweh had forgotten something he had been bidden to do, and Kilweh blushed red as he answered:  'My stepmother says that none but Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr, shall be my wife.'

"Is there a porter?' cried Kilweh, looking round for someone to open the gate.  'There is; and I am Arthur's porter every first day of January,' answered a man coming out to him. 'The rest of the year there are other porters, and among them Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet.'  'Well, open the portal, I say.'  'No, that I may not do, for none can enter save the son of a king or a pedlar who has goods to sell. But elsewhere there will be food for thy dogs and hay for thy horse, and for thee collops cooked and peppered, and sweet wine shall be served in the guest chamber.'  'That will not do for me,' answered Kilweh. 'If thou wilt not open the gate I will send up three shouts that shall be heard from Cornwall unto the north, and yet again to Ireland.'

"Then Glewlwyd went into the hall, and Arthur said to him:  'Do you have news from the gate?' and the porter answered:  'Far have I travelled, both in this island and elsewhere, and many kingly men have I seen; but never yet have I beheld one equal in majesty to him who now stands at the door.'  'If walking you did enter here, return you running,' replied Arthur, 'and let everyone that opens and shuts the eye show him respect and serve him, for it is not meet to keep such a man in the wind and rain.'

"I am not come,' replied Kilweh, 'for meat and drink, but to obtain a boon, and if you grant it me I will pay it back, and will carry thy praise to the four winds of heaven. But if you wilt not grant it to me, then I will proclaim your discourtesy wherever your name is known.'

"Forthwith he bade his men fetch him a comb of gold and a scissors with loops of silver, and he combed the hair of Kilweh his guest.  'Tell me who you are,' he said, 'for my heart warms to you, and I feel you are come of my blood.'  'I am Kilweh, son of Kilydd,' replied the youth.

"From this night to the end of the year right willingly will I grant you,' replied Kilweh; but when the end of the year came and the messengers returned Kilweh was wroth, and spoke rough words to Arthur.  It was Kai, the boldest of the warriors and the swiftest of foot--he would could pass nine nights without sleep, and nine days beneath the water--that answered him:  'Rash youth that you are, you are speak thus to Arthur?

"Then Arthur summoned his five best men and bade them go with Kilweh. There was Bedwyr the one-handed, Kai's comrade and brother in arms, the swiftest man in Britain save Arthur; there was Kynddelig, who knew the paths in a land where he had never been as surely as he did those of his own country; there was Gwrhyr, that could speak all tongues; and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, who never returned till he had gained what he sought; and last of all there was Menw, who could weave a spell over them so that none might see them, while they could see everyone.  So these seven journeyed together till they reached a vast open plain in which was a fair castle. But though it seemed so close it was not until the evening of the third day that they really drew near to it, and in front of it a flock of sheep was spread, so many in number that there seemed no end to them. A shepherd stood on a mound watching over them, and by his side was a dog, as large as a horse nine winters old.","['What did Arthur bade his five best men to do?', 'What did the shepherd do when they reached the fair castle?', ""What was the name of Kai's comrade and brother in arms?"", 'What could Menw weave a spell over?']","['How many sheep were spread in front of the castle?', 'How did the seven men reach the fair castle?', 'How did Arthur bring the seven men to the castle?', 'How did the seven men feel when they reached the castle?']","[""Who was Kai's comrade and brother in arms?"", 'Who never returned till he had gained what he sought?', 'Who could weave a spell over them so that none might see them?', 'Who could speak all tongues?']","['Why did Arthur send his five best men with Kilweh?', 'Why did the shepherd stand on a mound watching over them?', 'Why was Kynddelig the swiftest man in Britain?', 'Why did it seem so close to the castle?']","['Where did the seven men reach on the third day?', 'Where did the seven men stop their journey?', 'Where did the seven men stop walking?', 'Where did the seven men stop during their journey?']","['When did the seven men reach the fair castle?', 'When did the seven men reach the castle?', 'When did Arthur summon his five best men?', 'When did Arthur and the seven men reach the fair castle?']","['Which of the seven men could weave a spell over?', 'Which of the seven men could speak all tongues?', ""Which man was Kai's comrade and brother in arms?"", 'Which man never returned till he had gained what he sought?']"
"Whose is this castle, O herdsmen?' asked the knights.  'You are truly stupid,' answered the herdsman. 'All the world knows that this is the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.'  'And who are you?'  'I am called Custennin, brother of Yspaddaden, and ill has he treated me. And who are you, and what do you here?'  'We come from Arthur the king, to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden,' but at this news the shepherd gave a cry:  'O men, be warned and turn back while there is yet time. Others have gone on that quest, but none have escaped to tell the tale,' and he rose to his feet as if to leave them. Then Kilweh held out to him a ring of gold, and he tried to put it on his finger, but it was too small, so he placed it in his glove, and went home and gave it to his wife.","['What did Kilweh give to the shepherd?', 'What did the shepherd do after he heard the two knights were headed to Olwen?', 'What did the shepherd do after the two knights said they wanted to meet Olwen?', 'What happened after the two knights said they wanted to meet Olwen?']","['How did the shepherd feel after the seven men said they wanted to meet Olwen?', 'How did the shepherd feel after he heard the seven men were headed to Olwen?', 'How did the shepherd feel after Kilweh said he wanted to meet Olwen?', 'How did the shepherd feel when the seven men said they wanted to meet Olwen?']","['Who owned the castle?', 'Who was the brother of Yspaddaden?', 'Who was the owner of the castle?', 'Who were the seven men seeking?']","['Why did the shepherd give the gold ring to his wife?', 'Why did the shepherd cry after Kilweh said he wanted to meet Olwen?', 'Why did the shepherd tell his men to turn back?', 'Why did the shepherd tell his men to be warned?']","['Where did Kilweh give the gold ring to?', 'Where did the seven men go to seek Olwen?', 'Where was the castle of Yspaddaden?', 'Where did the seven men come from?']","['When did the shepherd give the gold ring to his wife?', 'When did the seven men arrive at the castle?', 'When did Kilweh give the shepherd the gold ring?', 'When the seven men said they wanted to meet Olwen?']","['Which one of the seven men was the brother of Yspaddaden?', 'Which shepherd gave the gold ring to his wife?', 'Which of the seven men had gone on the quest to find Olwen?', 'Which shepherd did Kilweh give the gold ring to?']"
"Where did this ring come from?' asked she, 'for such good luck is not wont to befall on you .'  'The man to whom this ring belonged you shall see here in the evening,' answered the shepherd; 'he is Kilweh, son of Kilydd, cousin to king Arthur, and he has come to seek Olwen.' And when the wife heard that she knew that Kilweh was her nephew, and her heart yearned after him, half with joy at the thought of seeing him, and half with sorrow for the doom she feared.  Soon they heard steps approaching, and Kai and the rest entered into the house and ate and drank. After that the woman opened a chest, and out of it came a youth with curling yellow hair.","[""What did the shepherd's wife do when she heard Kilweh was coming?"", ""What did the shepherd's wife do after she heard Kilweh was coming?"", ""What did the shepherd's wife do when she heard Kilweh was approaching?"", ""What did the shepherd's wife do after she heard Kilweh was approaching?""]","[""How did the shepherd's wife feel when she heard Kilweh was coming?"", ""How did the shepherd's wife feel when she heard Kilweh was here?"", ""How did the shepherd's wife feel when she heard Kilweh was approaching?"", ""How did the shepherd's wife feel after she heard Kilweh was coming?""]","['Who was Kilweh?', ""Who did the shepherd's wife meet that evening?"", 'Who was the son of Kilydd?', ""Who did the shepherd's wife hear approaching?""]","[""Why did the shepherd's wife feel scared for Kilweh?"", ""Why did the shepherd's wife feel excited when she heard Kilweh was coming?"", ""Why did the shepherd's wife feel excited when she heard about Kilweh?"", ""Why did the shepherd's wife feel excited when she heard Kilweh was approaching?""]","['Where did Kilweh come from?', 'Where did Kilweh come to seek Olwen?', 'Where did the shepherd and his wife go after they heard steps approaching?', 'Where did Kai and the rest go after they entered the house?']","['When did Kilweh come to seek Olwen?', ""When did the shepherd's wife hear about Kilweh?"", 'When did Kilweh arrive?', ""When did the shepherd's wife hear of Kilweh?""]","[""Which shepherd's son was Kilweh?"", ""Which shepherd's wife did not know Kilweh was?"", ""Which man did the shepherd's wife meet that evening?"", ""Which man did the shepherd's wife know Kilweh was?""]"
"It is a pity to hid him thus,' said Gwrhyr, 'for well I know that he has done no evil.'  'Three and twenty of my sons has Yspaddaden slain, and I have no more hope of saving this one,' replied she, and Kai was full of sorrow and answered:  'Let him come with me and be my comrade, and he shall never be slain unless I am slain also.' And so it was agreed.  'What is your errand here?' asked the woman.  'We seek Olwen the maiden for this youth,' answered Kai; 'does she ever come hither so that she may be seen?'  'She comes every Saturday to wash her hair, and in the vessel where she washes she leaves all her rings, and never does she so much as send a messenger to fetch them.'","['What did Olwen leave in the vessel where she washes?', ""What did Gwrhyr offer to the shepherd's wife?"", ""What did Gwrhyr do to save the shepherd's wife?"", 'What did Olwen the maiden do every Saturday?']","[""How did Gwrhyr feel when he heard the woman's story?"", ""How did Gwrhyr and Kai plan to save Olwen's son?"", 'How did Olwen wash her hair?', 'How did Gwrhyr feel when the woman said she could not save her son?']","['Who did Gwrhyr want to be his comrade?', 'Who came every Saturday to wash her hair?', 'Who did Olwen the maiden leave in the vessel?', 'Who did Gwrhyr and Kai seek for the youth?']","['Why did Gwrhyr want Olwen the maiden to come to slay Yspaddaden?', 'Why did Gwrhyr want to bring Yspaddaden with him?', 'Why did Gwrhyr say it was a pity for the woman to hide Yspaddaden?', 'Why did Olwen come every Saturday?']","['Where did Olwen come every Saturday?', 'Where did Olwen wash her hair?', 'Where did Gwrhyr and Kai go to find Olwen?', 'Where did Olwen leave all her rings?']","['When did Olwen come?', 'When did Olwen wash her hair?', 'When did Olwen come to the village?', 'When was Olwen the maiden coming?']","['Which youth did Gwrhyr want to be his comrade?', ""Which woman washed Olwen's hair every Saturday?"", 'Which youth did Gwrhyr want to bring with him?', 'Which youth did Gwrhyr want to hunt down?']"
"Will she come if she is bidden?' asked Kai, pondering.  'She will come; but unless you pledge me your faith that you will not harm her I will not fetch her.'  'We pledge it,' said they, and the maiden came.  A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with a collar of ruddy gold about her neck, bright with emeralds and rubies. More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands than the blossoms of the wood anemone.

"She entered, and sat down on a bench beside Kilweh, and he spake to her:  'Ah, maiden, since first I heard thy name I have loved thee--will you not come away with me from this evil place?'

'We come to ask thy daughter Olwen for Kilweh, son of Kilydd.'

"Shoot not at me again,' said he, 'unless you desire death. But lift up my eyebrows, which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see my son-in-law.' Then they arose, and as they did so Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilweh caught it, and flung it back, and it passed through his eyeball, and came out on the other side of his head.  'A gentle son-in-law, truly! Cursed be the fire in which it was forged and the man who fashioned it!'

"Open!' cried Gwrhyr.  'I will not open,' replied the porter.  'And wherefore?' asked Kai.

"Bid the man come before me,' cried Gwrnach, when the porter had told his tale, 'for my sword stands much in need of polishing,' so Kai passed in and saluted Gwrnach the giant.  'Is it true what I hear of thee, that you can burnish swords?'  'It is true,' answered Kai. Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.

"As you will,' answered the giant, and speedily did Kai polish half the sword. The giant marvelled at his skill, and said:  'It is a wonder that such a man as you should be without a companion.'  'I have a companion, noble sir, but he has no skill in this art.'  'What is his name?' asked the giant.  'Let the porter go forth, and I will tell him how he may know him.

"Now there was much talk amongst those who remained without when the gate closed upon Bedwyr, and Goreu, son of Custennin, prevailed with the porter, and he and his companions got in also and hid themselves.  By this time the whole of the sword was polished, and Kai gave it into the hand of Gwrnach the giant, who felt it and said:  'Your work is good; I am content.'  Then said Kai:  'It is your scabbard that has rusted thy sword; give it to me that I may take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones.' And he took the scabbard in one hand and the sword in the other, and came and stood behind the giant, as if he would have sheathed the sword in the scabbard. But with it he struck a blow at the head of the giant, and it rolled from his body. After that they despoiled the castle of its gold and jewels, and returned, bearing the sword of the giant, to Arthur's court.","['What happened after Kai struck a blow to Gwrnach?', 'What did Goreu, son of Custennin, prevail with the porter?', 'What happened after the gate closed upon Bedwyr?', 'What happened after Kai gave the sword to Gwrnach?']","['How did Gwrnach feel when he received the sword?', 'How did Kai trick Gwrnach?', 'How will Gwrnach feel when he gets his sword back?', 'How will Gwrnach feel when he receives the sword?']","['Who prevailed with the porter?', 'Who did Kai give the sword to?', 'Who remained without when the gate closed upon Bedwyr?', ""Who took the sword and jewels to Arthur's court?""]","[""Why did Goreu and his companions return to Arthur's court?"", 'Why was there much talk amongst those who remained without?', 'Why did Gwrnach give Kai the scabbard?', 'Why did Gwrnach the giant give Kai the sword?']","['Where did Kai and his companions return to?', 'Where did Kai and his companions go with the sword?', 'Where did Kai and his companions go to with the sword?', 'Where did Kai and his companions go to after they defeated the giants?']","['When did Kai give the sword to Gwrnach?', 'When the gate closed upon Bedwyr?', ""When did the sword roll from Gwrnach's body?"", ""When did Kai return the sword to Arthur's court?""]","['Which son of Custennin prevailed with the porter?', 'Which sword did Kai give to Gwrnach?', ""Which of the seven men took the sword to Arthur's court?"", 'Which one of the seven men saved Gwrnach?']"
"They told Arthur how they had sped, and they all took counsel together, and agreed that they must set out on the quest for Mabon the son of Modron, and Gwrhyr, who knew the languages of beasts and of birds, went with them. So they journeyed until they came to the nest of an ousel, and Gwrhyr spoke to her.  'Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall.'  And the ousel answered:  'When I first came here I was a young bird, and there was a smith's anvil in this place. But from that time no work has been done upon it, save that every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof.

"So the ousel flew before them, till she reached the stag of Redynvre; but when they inquired of the stag whether he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head.  'When first I came hither,' said he, 'the plain was bare save for one oak sapling, which grew up to be an oak with a hundred branches. All that is left of that oak is a withered stump, but never once have I heard of the man you name. Nevertheless, as you are Arthur's men, I will guide you to the place where there is an animal older than I'; and the stag ran before them till he reached the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd.

"So they followed the eagle, who flew before them, though so high was he in the sky, it was often hard to mark his flight. At length he stopped above a deep pool in a river.  'Salmon of Llyn Llyw,' he called, 'I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to inquire if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron.' And the salmon answered:  'As much as I know I will tell thee. With every tide I go up the river, till I reach the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found elsewhere. And that you may see that what I say is true let two of you go thither on my shoulders.'

"Who is it that thus laments in this house of stone?'  'It is I, Mabon the son of Modron.'  'Will silver or gold bring thy freedom, or only battle and fighting?' asked Gwrhyr again.

"Then they sent a messenger to Arthur to tell him that Mabon was found, and he brought all his warriors to the castle of Gloucester and fell fiercely upon it; while Kai and Bedwyr went on the shoulders of the salmon to the gate of the dungeon, and broke it down and carried away Mabon. And he now being free returned home with Arthur.  After this, on a certain day, as Gwythyr was walking across a mountain he heard a grievous cry, and he hastened towards it. In a little valley he saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the anthill, and all the ants were hurrying to and fro, not knowing whither to go. Gwythyr had pity on them, and put out the fire, and in gratitude the ants brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspaddaden Penkawr required of Kilweh. And many of the other marvels were done likewise by Arthur and his knights, and at last it came to the fight with Trwyth the board, to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor that lay between his ears.

"Long, long ago, there once lived a king and a queen who had a daughter. One day, when the daughter went walking in the garden, a tremendous storm suddenly came up and carried her away with it.

"Now a youth had seen the bird as he was carrying the princess to his cave. This cave, though, was in the middle of a sheer wall of rock. One could not climb up to it from below, nor could one climb down to it from above. And as the youth was walking around the rock, another youth came along and asked him what he was doing there.

"And when he went into the cave, he saw the king's daughter sitting there, and washing the wound of the bird with nine heads; for the hound of heaven had bitten off his tenth head, and his wound was still bleeding. The princess, however, motioned to the youth to hide, and he did so. When the king's daughter had washed his wound and bandaged it, the bird with nine heads felt so comfortable, that one after another, all his nine heads fell asleep.

"He then went on until he found a tortoise-shell full of beautiful pearls.

"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew.  Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time.","['What was the sprite able to change into?', ""What was the sprite's name?"", 'What did Puck spend his night doing?', ""What was the sprite's delight to do?""]","['How could the spirit change into any shape he wanted?', 'How did the sprite play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys?', 'How will the cowboys feel when they hear a loud clang?', 'How did the sprite feel to play tricks on everybody?']","['Who was the mischievous kind of spirit?', 'Who dwelt among the mountain pastures and valleys?', 'Who could not change into any shape?', 'Who did the sprite turn into?']","[""Why couldn't the spirit transform into a man, woman or child?"", 'Why did the sprite unfasten the chains in the cowsheds?', ""Why didn't everyone know when they were safe from the mischievous kind of spirit?"", ""Why didn't everyone know when they were safe from the mischievous kind of sprite?""]","['Where did the mischievous kind of spirit live?', 'Where did Puck go to play tricks on everybody?', 'Where did the mischievous kind of spirit dwell?', 'Where did Puck spend his night?']","['When was the sprite most often chosen to perform his pranks?', 'When did the sprite unfasten the chains?', 'When did the sprite go into the cowsheds?', 'When did the sprite come to visit everyone?']","['Which kind of spirit dwelt in the centre of France?', 'Which shape could the mischievous kind of spirit change into?', 'Which animal could the sprite turn into?', 'Which sprite could only change into a needle?']"
"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load.  'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump.  'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered:  'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.'  In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears. Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear!

"Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he should be the next victim. After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport. At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest town to buy all that they needed for setting up house. Quite certain that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their return journey. He changed himself into a fly in order to overhear their conversation.  For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next month, and who were to be invited. This led the bride to her wedding dress, and she gave a little scream.  'Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!'  'Dear, dear!' exclaimed the young man. 'That is unlucky.

"The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball of thread of all colours. All the colours, that is, of the dresses that were tied on to the back of the cart.  'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he sprang out to get it. 'One would think a fairy had put it there on purpose.'  'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl. As she spoke she seemed to hear an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was nonsense.  The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. It matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or broke perpetually, as most thread did. She finished her work much quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come to the church and see her in her wedding dress.  There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony. The young people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents were very rich. The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from afar, walking under the chestnut avenue.","['What was the young people immense favourites in the neighbourhood?', 'What did the bridegroom see on one side of the road?', 'What did the dressmaker do much quicker than she expected?', 'What did the bridegroom see on the side of the road?']","['How did the dressmaker feel when she finished the thread?', 'How did the bridegroom feel when he saw thread on the side of the road?', 'How did the dressmaker feel when she finished her work?', 'How did the bridegroom feel when he saw thread?']","['Who were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents were very rich?', 'Who did the bridegroom see on one side of the road?', 'Who did the bridegroom believe put the thread in the cart?', 'Who assembled to witness the ceremony?']","['Why was there a large ball of thread on the side of the road?', 'Why was there a large ball of thread on one side of the road?', 'Why was there a large ball of thread?', 'Why did the bridegroom believe a fairy put the thread in the cart?']","['Where was the bride walking?', 'Where could the bride be seen from?', 'Where was the crowd assembled?', 'Where did the bridegroom find thread?']","['When did the bridegroom see thread on the side of the road?', 'When was the bride to be brought to the church?', 'When did the bridegroom find thread?', 'When was the bride to be seen?']","['Which young people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood?', 'Which thread did the bridegroom find on the side of the road?', 'Which color thread did the bridegroom find on the side of the road?', 'Which color thread did the bridegroom see on the side of the road?']"
"What a beautiful girl!' exclaimed the men. 'What a lovely dress!' whispered the women. But just as she entered the church and took the hand of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard.  'Crick! crack! Crick! crack!' and the wedding garments fell to the ground, to the great confusion of the wearer.  Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! Cloaks in profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so upset that she could hardly keep from tears. One of the guests, more curious than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined, if she could, to find out the cause of the disaster.

"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.  LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!

"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a VERY small person.  Lucie ran on, and on.  THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      ""Lily-white and clean, oh!     With little frills between, oh!

"LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?""  Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.  THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.  Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!","['What was the stout short person wearing?', 'What was the kitchen like?', 'What was the little frightened voice doing when Lucie opened the door?', 'What did the stout short person have in her hand?']","['How does the story describe the kitchen?', 'How did the stout short person look?', 'How did the stout short person feel when she saw Lucie?', 'How was the kitchen different from any other farm kitchen?']","['Who was the stout short person?', 'Who was at the table?', 'Who was in the kitchen?', 'Who was the very stout short person?']","['Why was the stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie?', 'Why did the little frightened voice call out ""Who\'s that?""', 'Why was the kitchen like any other farm kitchen?', 'Why did the stout short person have prickles?']","['Where did Lucie find the stout short person?', 'Where did Lucie go after she interrupted the song?', 'Where did the stout short person stand?', 'Where was the kitchen?']","[""When did Lucie enter the little frightened voice's house?"", 'When did the stout short person appear?', 'When did Lucie enter the hill?', ""When did Lucie enter the little frightened voice's home?""]","['Which one of the little people had prickles?', 'Which voice called out ""Who\'s that?""', 'Which little frightened voice called out ""Who\'s that?""', 'Which little person was in the kitchen?']"

The little person made a bob-curtsey--""Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!""

"There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, ""Tin soldiers!"" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable.","['What were all the tin soldiers made from?', 'What was the first thing the tin soldiers heard?', 'What did the boy do when the lid was taken off?', 'What were all the tin soldiers made out of?']","['How many tin soldiers are there?', 'How many tin soldiers were there?', 'How were all the tin soldiers made?', 'How did the tin soldiers look?']","['Who had only one leg?', 'Who was the one who had only one leg?', 'Who were all brothers?', 'Who were all made from the same old tin spoon?']","['Why did one of the tin soldiers only have one leg?', 'Why were there five-and-twenty tin soldiers?', 'Why did one of the tin soldiers have only one leg?', 'Why were all the tin soldiers made from the same old spoon?']","['Where were all the tin soldiers made from?', 'Where did the boy stand to set the soldiers up?', 'Where were the tin soldiers made from?', 'Where did the tin soldiers live?']","['When was the first thing the tin soldiers heard?', 'When was the lid of the box taken off?', 'When were all the tin soldiers made?', 'When were the tin soldiers made?']","['Which one of the tin soldiers only has one leg?', 'Which one of the tin soldiers only had one leg?', 'Which one of the tin soldiers had only one leg?', 'Which of the tin soldiers only had one leg?']"
"The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face.","['What did the tiny little lady look like?', 'What was the most attractive to the eye?', 'What surrounded the little trees?', 'What did the tiny little lady wear?']","['How does the story describe the castle?', 'How did the tiny little lady look?', 'How was the tiny little lady made?', 'How did the tiny little lady feel?']","['Who stood at the door of the castle?', 'Who was the prettiest of all?', 'Who was the most attractive to the eye?', 'Who stood at the open door of the castle?']","['Why was the tiny little lady the prettiest?', 'Why was there a glittering tinsel rose?', 'Why was the castle surrounded with little trees?', 'Why was the castle a pretty little castle?']","['Where did the tiny little lady stand?', 'Where did the little trees surrounded?', 'Where was the pretty little castle?', 'Where did the little trees stand?']","['When was the tiny little lady to be seen?', 'When was the tiny little lady born?', 'When did the tiny little lady appear?', 'When was the tiny little lady to be born?']","['Which toy was the most attractive to the eye?', 'Which tiny little lady stood at the door of the castle?', 'Which castle was the most attractive to the eye?', 'Which room was the most attractive to the eye?']"
"The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. ""That is the wife for me,"" he thought; ""but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her. Still I must try and make her acquaintance.""

"When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle.","['What did the canary do when it woke up?', 'What happened when the people of the house went to bed?', 'What did the canary do when she woke up?', 'What did the goblins do when they could not open the lid?']","['How did the canary feel when she woke up?', 'How did the goblins feel when they could not open the lid?', ""How did the goblins feel when they couldn't open the lid?"", 'How will the goblins feel when they see the canary?']","['Who sprang up from the lid of the snuff-box?', 'Who woke up and began to talk?', 'Who could not open the lid?', 'Who did the people of the house put in the box?']","[""Why couldn't the tin soldiers open the lid?"", 'Why did the canary begin to talk?', 'Why did the canary stand on tiptoe?', 'Why did the little black goblin jump up in the snuff-box?']","['Where did the little black goblin jump up from?', 'Where were the other tin soldiers placed?', 'Where were the other playthings placed?', 'Where were the other toys placed?']","['When did the playthings begin to have their own games?', 'When did the people of the house go to bed?', 'When did the canary wake up?', 'When did the other tin soldiers want to go outside?']","['Which toy was in the box instead of snuff?', 'Which one of the playthings could not open the lid?', 'Which toy did the people of the house have?', 'Which toy remained in its places?']"
"""Tin soldier,"" said the goblin, ""don't wish for what does not belong to you."" But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. ""Very well; wait till to-morrow, then,"" said the goblin. When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he had called out, ""Here I am,"" it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform.","['What did the goblin tell the tin soldier?', 'What did the children place in the window?', 'What did the goblin tell the tin soldier to do?', 'What happened when the window flew open?']","['How did the goblin trick the tin soldier?', 'How did the tin soldier fall out of the window?', 'How did the goblin feel when the tin soldier refused to leave?', 'How did the children find the tin soldier?']","['Who did the goblin tell the tin soldier not to do?', 'Who did the goblin place in the window?', 'Who did the goblin tell to not wish for?', 'Who did the goblin tell to wait for?']","[""Why didn't the tin soldier call out for help?"", 'Why did the goblin tell the tin soldier not to wish for anything?', 'Why did the goblin tell the tin soldier to wait?', 'Why was it a terrible fall for the tin soldier?']","['Where did the tin soldier fall?', 'Where did the goblin place the tin soldier?', 'Where did the children place the tin soldier the next morning?', 'Where did the goblin tell the tin soldier to go?']","['When did the goblin tell the tin soldier not to wish for what did not belong to him?', 'When did the goblin tell the tin soldier to leave?', 'When did the goblin tell the tin soldier to come back?', 'When did the goblin tell the tin soldier to go home?']","['Which child put the tin soldier in the window?', 'Which goblin told the tin soldier not to wish for?', 'Which child did the goblin place in the window?', 'Which one of the children flew open the window?']"
"Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, ""Look, there is a tin soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in."" So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket. Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box.","['What did the tin soldier do when the boat shot under a bridge?', 'What did the two boys make a boat out of?', 'What did the tin soldier do when he was in the boat?', 'What did the tin soldier do when he was sent sailing down the gutter?']","['How did the tin soldier feel when the boat shot under a bridge?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when the boat rocked up and down?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when the boat turned itself around sometimes so quickly?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when he was sent sailing down the gutter?']","['Who found the tin soldier?', 'Who saw the tin soldier sailing down the gutter?', ""Who saw the tin soldier's box?"", 'Who had a boat to sail in?']","['Why did the tin soldier have a boat to sail in?', 'Why did the tin soldier feel scared when he was on the boat?', ""Why was it dark as the tin soldier's box?"", 'Why did the tin soldier not change his countenance?']","['Where did the tin soldier sail down?', 'Where did the tin soldier sail to?', ""Where did the tin soldier's boat go?"", ""Where did the tin soldier's boat sail to?""]","[""When was it dark as the tin soldier's box?"", 'When did the tin soldier feel scared?', 'When did it begin to rain?', ""When did the tin soldier reach the river's edge?""]","['Which boy found the tin soldier?', 'Which boy found the tin soldier and brought him home?', 'Which one of the two boys found the tin soldier?', ""Which boy saw the tin soldier's box?""]"
"""Where am I going now?"" thought he. ""This is the black goblin's fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness."" Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. ""Have you a passport?"" asked the rat, ""give it to me at once."" But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, ""Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."" But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man.","['What did the great water-rat do when he saw the tin soldier?', 'What did the water-rat do when he saw the tin soldier?', 'What did the water-rat want from the tin soldier?', 'What did the water-rat do to stop the tin soldier?']","['How did the water rat feel when he saw the tin soldier?', 'How did the water-rat feel when he saw the tin soldier?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when he saw the great water-rat?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when he heard the roaring sound?']","['Who appeared in the drain?', 'Who lived in the drain?', 'Who was the great water-rat?', 'Who did the tin soldier see where the arch ended?']","['Why did the water rat want to stop the tin soldier?', 'Why was the tin soldier afraid of the water-rat?', 'Why did the water-rat want to stop the tin soldier?', 'Why did the water-rat appear in the drain?']","['Where did the tin soldier see daylight shining?', 'Where did the water-rat live?', 'Where did the tin soldier and the rat go?', 'Where did the river-boat stop?']","['When was daylight shining where the arch ended?', 'When did the great water-rat appear?', 'When did the water-rat appear?', 'When did the great water-rat live?']","['Which water rat appeared in the drain?', 'Which water-rat appeared in the drain?', 'Which boat did the great water-rat follow?', 'Which water-rat lived in the drain?']"
"At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears--""Farewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave.""","['What happened because the tin soldier was too close to the drain?', 'What happened when the tin soldier reached the end of the tunnel?', 'What did the tin soldier think about once he was under water?', 'What did the boat do when it filled with water?']","['How did the tin soldier feel when he was drowning?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when the water closed over his head?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when he was in the water?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when the water closed over him?']","['Who did the tin soldier think of once he was under water?', 'Who did the tin soldier never see again?', 'Who did the tin soldier think he would never see again?', 'Who did the tin soldier think about?']","['Why did the tin soldier think of the elegant little dancer?', 'Why did the tin soldier hold himself as stiffly as possible?', 'Why was it dangerous for the tin soldier to go through the tunnel?', 'Why could nothing save the boat from sinking?']","['Where did the drain fall?', 'Where did the drain fall into?', ""Where did the water close over the tin soldier's head?"", 'Where did the tin soldier go after he got into the boat?']","[""When did the water close over the tin soldier's head?"", 'When was it dangerous for the tin soldier to reach the end of the tunnel?', 'When was it dangerous for the tin soldier to go through the tunnel?', ""When did the water close over the soldier's head?""]","['Which part of the drain fell into?', 'Which part of the tunnel was dangerous for the tin soldier?', 'Which boat did the tin soldier ride into the water?', 'Which soldier did the tin soldier think about when he was drowning?']"
"Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish. Oh how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket.","['What happened when the boat fell to pieces?', 'What happened after the boat fell to pieces?', 'What did the tin soldier do after he entered the fish?', 'What did the fish do to the tin soldier?']","[""How did the tin soldier feel when he entered the fish's mouth?"", 'How did the tin soldier feel when he was swallowed up by the fish?', 'How did the tin soldier feel when he was swallowed up by a fish?', 'How did the tin soldier feel after sinking into the water?']","['Who sank into the water and was swallowed up by a great fish?', 'Who did the tin soldier meet inside the fish?', 'Who was swallowed up by a great fish?', ""Who did the tin soldier meet inside the fish's mouth?""]","['Why was it dark inside the fish?', 'Why was the tin soldier swallowed up by a fish?', 'Why did the tin soldier continue to stand firm?', 'Why did the tin soldier continue to hold his musket?']","['Where was the tin soldier after the boat fell to pieces?', 'Where was the fish taking the tin soldier?', 'Where was it dark inside the fish?', 'Where did the soldier lay after the boat fell to pieces?']","['When was the tin soldier swallowed up by a great fish?', 'When did the boat fall to pieces?', ""When did the tin soldier reach the fish's mouth?"", 'When was it dark inside the fish?']","['Which fish swallowed up the tin soldier?', 'Which boat fell to pieces?', 'Which fish swallowed the tin soldier?', 'Which fish swallowed up the Tin soldier?']"
"The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, ""I declare here is the tin soldier."" The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and--how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.","['What did the cook do when she found the soldier?', 'What happened after a flash of lightning seemed to pass through the fish?', 'What did the children do when they saw the tin soldier?', 'What did the children do when they saw the soldier?']","['How did the soldier feel when he was brought into the room?', 'How did the cook feel when she found the soldier?', 'How did the soldier feel when he saw himself in the window?', 'How did the children feel when they saw the soldier?']","['Who found the tin soldier?', 'Who was not at all proud?', 'Who found the soldier?', 'Who took the soldier to the market?']","['Why was the tin soldier not at all proud?', 'Why were the children anxious to see the tin soldier?', 'Why did the cook cut the soldier open?', 'Why did the cook carry the soldier into the room?']","['Where was the tin soldier when they found him?', 'Where was the tin soldier when he was found?', 'Where was the tin soldier after he was caught?', 'Where did the soldiers find the tin soldier?']","['When did the cook find the soldier?', 'When was the tin soldier found?', 'When did the cook find the tin soldier?', 'When was the soldier brought to the castle?']","['Which one of the children found the tin soldier?', 'Which one of the children found the soldier?', 'Which child found the tin soldier?', 'Which fish was the tin soldier?']"
"It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at her and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say.

"Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.

"Down in Fannet, in times gone by, lived Jamie Freel and his mother. Jamie was the widow's sole support. His strong arm worked for her untiringly, and as each Saturday night came round he poured his wages into her lap, thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco.  He was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of. But he had neighbours of whose opinions he was ignorant. Neighbours who lived pretty close to him, whom he had never seen, who are, indeed, rarely seen by mortals, except on May Eves or Halloweens.  An old ruined castle, about a quarter of a mile from his cabin, was said to be the abode of the ""wee folk."" Every Halloween were the ancient windows lighted up, and passersby saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building, while they heard the music of flutes and pipes.  It was well known that fairy revels took place. Nobody had the courage to intrude on them.  Jamie had often watched the little figures from a distance, and listened to the charming music, wondering what the inside of the castle was like.  One Halloween he got up, and took his cap, saying to his mother, ""I'm awa to the castle to seek my fortune.""  ""What!"" cried she. ""Would you venture there--you that's the widow's only son? Dinna be so venturesome and foolitch, Jamie! They'll kill you, an' then what'll come o' me?""

"He set out, and, as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab-tree branches, into gold.  Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry. The laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed.  Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted.  ""Welcome, Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" cried the company, perceiving their visitor. The word ""Welcome"" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle.  Time flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, ""We're going to ride to Dublin to-night to steal a young lady. Will you come, too, Jamie Freel?""  ""Ay, that I will,"" cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure.  A troop of horses stood at the door. Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air. He was presently flying over his mother's cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop. On and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry Halloween. It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin.  ""This is Derry,"" said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire. What was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest, till fifty little voices were crying out, ""Derry! Derry! Derry!""","['What did the little people want Jamie to do with them?', 'What did the little people plan to do in Dublin?', 'What did the little people invite Jamie to do with them?', 'What made Jamie more determined to proceed?']","['How did Jamie feel about the elfin revelry?', 'How did the little people feel when they saw Jamie?', 'How did Jamie feel while he was watching the little people dancing?', 'How did Jamie feel while he was watching the little people?']","['Who were dancing to music of flutes and fiddles?', 'Who did the little people invite to Dublin with them?', 'Who were dancing and feasting in the castle?', 'Who were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles?']","['Why did Jamie agree to steal a young lady with his hosts?', 'Why did Jamie agree to steal a young lady?', 'Why did Jamie want to steal a young lady?', 'Why did Jamie want to go to Dublin?']","['Where did the little people say Derry was?', 'Where did Jamie and the little people fly to?', 'Where did the little people plan to ride to?', 'Where did the little people plan to go?']","['When did the little people plan to go to Dublin?', 'When did Jamie come in sight of the castle?', 'When did Jamie and the little people fly to Dublin?', 'When did the little people want to go to Dublin?']","['Which castle was ablaze with light?', 'Which little people were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles?', 'Which castle did Jamie see as he crossed the potato field?', 'Which castle did Jamie see ablaze with light?']"
"In like manner was Jamie informed as they passed over each town on the route, and at length he heard the silvery voices cry, ""Dublin! Dublin!""  It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen's Green.  The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed. He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form.  The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before.  They were approaching home. Jamie heard ""Rathmullan,"" ""Milford,"" ""Tamney,"" and then he knew they were near his own house.  ""You've all had your turn at carrying the young lady,"" said he. ""Why wouldn't I get her for a wee piece?""  ""Ay, Jamie,"" replied they pleasantly, ""you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure.""  Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door.  ""Jamie Freel! Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?"" cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door.  Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then again a sack of wool.  But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, ""Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll mak' her deaf and dumb,"" and she threw something over the young girl.","['What did the tiny woman do to the young girl?', 'What did Jamie see when the troop dismounted near a window?', 'What did the lady try to do when she was a black dog?', 'What did the lady do when she was a black dog?']","['How did Jamie know they were near his own house?', 'How did Jamie feel when he saw the stick turn into a woman?', 'How did Jamie feel when he saw the young lady lifted and carried away?', 'How did the young lady feel when she was a black dog?']","['Who did the tiny woman throw over the young girl?', 'Who was the smallest of the party?', 'Who did Jamie see lifted and carried away?', 'Who was placed before one rider and carried a short way?']","['Why did the tiny woman threaten to make the young girl deaf and dumb?', 'Why did the tiny woman throw something over the young girl?', 'Why did the little folk turn the lady into a black dog?', 'Why did Jamie not know what he was holding?']","[""Where was the beautiful young lady's dwelling?"", 'Where did the young lady live?', ""Where was the young lady's dwelling?"", 'Where were the young lady and the lad approaching?']","['When did the young lady turn into a black dog?', 'When was the dwelling to be honoured by the fairy visit?', 'When did Jamie know they were near his own house?', 'When was the young lady lifted and carried away?']","['Which dwelling was to be honoured by the fairy visit?', ""Which of the little folk said Jamie would mak' the young girl deaf and dumb?"", ""Which town was near Jamie's own house?"", 'Which town was Jamie informed about as they passed over each town?']"
"While they rode off, disappointed, Jamie Freel lifted the latch and went in.  ""Jamie man!"" cried his mother, ""you've been away all night. What have they done on you?""  ""Naething bad, mother. I have the very best o' gude luck. Here's a beautiful young lady I hae brought you for company.""  ""Bless us and save us!"" exclaimed his mother. For some minutes she was so astonished she could not think of anything else to say.  Jamie told the story of the night's adventure, ending by saying, ""Surely you wouldna have allowed me to let her gang with them to be lost for ever?""  ""But a lady, Jamie! How can a lady eat we'er (our) poor diet and live in we'er poor way? I ax you that, you foolitch fellow!""  ""Well, mother, sure it's better for her to be over here nor yonder,"" and he pointed in the direction of the castle.  Meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire.  ""Poor crathur, she's quare and handsome! Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,"" said the old woman, gazing at their guest with pity and admiration. ""We maun dress her first. What in the name o' fortune have I fit for the likes of her to wear?""  She went to her press in ""the room"" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget. She then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings, a long snowy garment of fine linen, and a cap, her ""dead dress,"" as she called it.","['What did Jamie\'s mother take from ""the room""?', 'What happened after Jamie Freel lifted the latch and went in?', ""What did Jamie's mother do when she saw the young woman?"", ""What did Jamie tell his mother about the night's adventure?""]","[""How did Jamie's mother feel when she saw the young woman?"", ""How did Jamie's mother feel when she saw the young lady?"", ""How did Jamie's mother feel after she saw the young woman?"", ""How did Jamie's mother feel when she saw the young girl?""]","['Who did Jamie Freel bring with him to the castle?', ""Who did Jamie's mother think the young lady was?"", ""Who did Jamie's mother invite to dinner?"", ""Who did Jamie's mother bring to dinner?""]","[""Why did Jamie's mother feel bad for crathur?"", ""Why did Jamie Freel's mother feel bad for crathur?"", ""Why did Jamie Freel's mother feel bad for the girl?"", ""Why was Jamie Freel's mother astonished that he brought home a girl?""]","[""Where did Jamie tell his mother the story of the night's adventure?"", 'Where did Jamie Freel tell his mother to send the girl?', 'Where did Jamie tell his mother to send the girl?', 'Where did Jamie Freel tell his mother to take the girl?']","[""When did Jamie Freel's mother bring the girl to him?"", ""When did Jamie Freel's mother bring the girl?"", ""When did Jamie Freel's mother arrive home?"", ""When did Jamie Freel's mother find out about the girl?""]","[""Which room did Jamie's mother take the girl to?"", 'Which room did Jamie tell his mother the girl was in?', 'Which room did Jamie say was better for the girl?', 'Which room did Jamie tell his mother the story of?']"
"These articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony, in which she would some day fill the chief part, and only saw the light occasionally when they were hung out to air. She was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her.  The poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a ""creepie"" in the chimney corner and buried her face in her hands.  ""What'll we do to keep up a lady like you?"" cried the old woman.  ""I'll work for you both, mother,"" replied the son.  ""An' how could a lady live on we'er poor diet?"" she repeated.  ""I'll work for her,"" was all Jamie's answer.  He kept his word. The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening, while the old woman span by the fire and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment acquired by him in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest.  But she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her. By degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.  So a year passed and Halloween came round again.

"""Are you mad, Jamie?"" cried his mother in terror. ""Sure they'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year.""  Jamie made light of her fears and went his way.  As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.""  ""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.""  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!""  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.""  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  ""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother.  ""No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!"" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.  The lady began to speak, and her first words were words of thanks to Jamie.  The three inmates of the cabin had so much to say to one another that, long after cock-crow, when the fairy music had quite ceased, they were talking round the fire.","['What happened after Jamie snatched the glass from the tiny woman?', 'What did the lady say her first words were?', 'What did the wee folk say about Jamie stealing the young lady?', 'What did the wee folk do long after cock-crow had quite ceased?']","['How did Jamie feel when he saw bright lights in the castle windows?', 'How did the young lady feel when she saw Jamie?', 'How did the wee folk feel about Jamie stealing their young lady?', 'How did Jamie feel when he saw the castle windows?']","['Who did the wee folk say played a poor trick on?', 'Who did the tiny woman punish for stealing the young lady?', 'Who had so much to say to one another?', 'Who did Jamie see in the castle windows?']","['Why did the wee folk treat Jamie kindly even though they disliked him?', 'Why did the tiny woman treat Jamie kindly even though she disliked him?', 'Why did the wee folk treat Jamie kindly even though they hated him?', 'Why did the tiny woman punish Jamie?']","['Where did Jamie see bright lights in the castle windows?', 'Where did Jamie find the young lady?', 'Where did Jamie reach after his mad race over the potato field?', 'Where did Jamie find the wee folk?']","['When did the lady begin to speak?', 'When did Jamie reach the crab tree grove?', 'When did Jamie reach the crab-tree grove?', 'When did Jamie arrive at the castle?']","['Which wee folk did Jamie see in the castle windows?', 'Which one of the wee folk did Jamie steal the young lady from?', 'Which one of the three inmates of the cabin had so much to say?', 'Which wee folk did Jamie meet when he entered the hall?']"
"""Jamie,"" said the lady, ""be pleased to get me paper and pen and ink that I may write to my father and tell him what has become of me.""  She wrote, but weeks passed and she received no answer. Again and again she wrote, and still no answer.  At length she said, ""You must come with me to Dublin, Jamie, to find my father.""  ""I have no money to hire a car for you,"" he answered. ""An' how can you travel to Dublin on your foot?""  But she implored him so much that he consented to set out with her and walk all the way from Fannet to Dublin. It was not as easy as the fairy journey. But at last they rang the bell at the door of the house in Stephen's Green.  ""Tell my father that his daughter is here,"" said she to the servant who opened the door.  ""The gentleman that lives here has no daughter, my girl. He had one, but she died better nor a year ago.""  ""Do you not know me, Sullivan?""  ""No, poor girl, I do not.""  ""Let me see the gentleman. I only ask to see him.""

"It became Jamie's turn to speak, and he gave the history of the fairy journey, of the theft of the young lady, of the figure he had seen laid in its place, of her life with his mother in Fannet, of last Halloween, and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantments.  She took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her.  The parents could not make enough of Jamie. They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude.  But an awkward complication arose. The daughter would not let him go without her. ""If Jamie goes, I'll go, too,"" she said. ""He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since. If it had not been for him, dear father and mother, you would never have seen me again. If he goes, I'll go, too.""  This being her resolution, the old gentleman said that Jamie should become his son-in-law. The mother was brought from Fannet in a coach-and-four, and there was a splendid wedding.

"These are my children!' said Insato, waving his hand towards the people.  Gopani-Kufa was much astonished at all that he saw, but he said nothing.  Presently they came to the town; everything here, too, was beautiful, and everything that a man might desire he could obtain. Even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver.  Insato conducted Gopani-Kufa to the palace, and showing him his rooms, and the maidens who would wait upon him, told him that they would have a great feast that night, and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of Pita and it should be given him.

"Now Gopani-Kufa had a wasp called Zengi-mizi.  Zengi-mizi was not an ordinary wasp, for the spirit of the father of Gopani-Kufa had entered it, so that it was exceedingly wise.  In times of doubt Gopani-Kufa always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done, so on this occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried it, saying: 'Zengi-mizi, what gift shall I ask of Insato to-morrow when he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life?'  'Biz-z-z,' hummed Zengi-mizi, 'ask him for Sipao the Mirror.'

"Gopani-Kufa was astonished at this answer; but knowing that the words of Zengi-mizi were true words, he determined to make the request.  So that night they feasted, and on the morrow Insato came to Gopani-Kufa and, giving him greeting joyfully, he said:  'Now, O my friend, name your choice amongst my possessions and you shall have it!'  'O king!' answered Gopani-Kufa, 'out of all your possessions I will have the Mirror, Sipao.'  The king started.  'O friend, Gopani-Kufa,' he said, 'ask anything but that!

"But the king was still much troubled, fearing the loss of Sipao, for the mirror had magic powers, so that he who owned it had but to ask and his wish would be fulfilled; to it Insato owed all that he possessed.  As soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi, out of his basket.  'Zengi-mizi,' he said, 'the king seems loth to grant my request for the Mirror--is there not some other thing of equal value for which I might ask?'  And the wasp answered: 'There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa, which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and accomplishes the desires of him who owns it.  If the king hesitates, go to him the next day, and the day after, and in the end he will bestow the Mirror upon you, for you saved his life.'","['What did Gopani-Kufa do after the king left him?', 'What did the wasp say was of great value?', 'What would happen if the king hesitates?', 'What did Gopani-Kufa ask for?']","['How did the king feel about the loss of Sipao?', 'How did Gopani-Kufa feel after the king left?', 'How did the king feel when he lost Sipao?', 'How will the king feel when he loses the mirror?']","['Who did the king fear the loss of?', 'Who did the king owe all that he possessed to?', 'Who did Gopani-Kufa take?', 'Who did the king owe all of his possessions to?']","['Why did the king fear the loss of Sipao?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa take Zengi-mizi?', 'Why did the king still fear the loss of Sipao?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa need to ask the king for the mirror?']","['Where did Gopani-Kufa take Zengi-mizi?', 'Where did Gopani-Kufa tell Zengi-mizi to go?', 'Where did Gopani-Kufa tell Zengi-Mizi to go?', 'Where did Gopani-Kufa tell Zengo-mizi to go?']","['When did the king fear the loss of Sipao?', 'When did the king have to give the mirror to Insato?', 'When did Gopani-Kufa return?', 'When would the king bestow the mirror upon Gopani-Kufa?']","['Which was the most valuable item Gopani-Kufa has?', 'Which was the most valuable item in the basket?', 'Which was the most valuable thing in the world?', 'Which was the king most troubled about?']"
"And it was even so.  For three days Gopani- Kufa returned the same answer to the king, and, at last, with tears in his eyes, Insato gave him the Mirror, which was of polished iron, saying: 'Take Sipao, then, O Gopani- Kufa, and may thy wishes come true.  Go back now to thine own country; Sipao will show you the way.'  Gopani-Kufa was greatly rejoiced, and, taking farewell of the king, said to the Mirror:  'Sipao, Sipao, I wish to be back upon the Earth again!'

"When he arrived home he found his wife and daughter mourning for him, for they thought that he had been eaten by lions; but he comforted them, saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again.  That night he asked Zengi-mizi, in whom sat the spirit of his father, what he had better ask Sipao for next?  'Biz-z-z,' said the wasp, 'would you not like to be as great a chief as Insato?'

"Gopani-Kufa was now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles had been, and he and his family moved into the palace that stood high above the other buildings right in the middle of the town.  His wife was too astonished at all these wonders to ask any questions, but his daughter Shasasa kept begging him to tell her how he had suddenly become so great; so at last he revealed the whole secret, and even entrusted Sipao the Mirror to her care, saying:  'It will be safer with you, my daughter, for you dwell apart; whereas men come to consult me on affairs of state, and the Mirror might be stolen.'","['What did Gopani-Kufa entrust to his daughter?', 'What did Gopani-Kufa and his family do when they moved into the palace?', 'What did Shasasa do because Gopani-Kufa entrusted the mirror to her?', 'What did Shasasa beg Gopani-Kufa to tell her?']","['How did Shasasa feel when Gopani-Kufa entrusted the mirror to her?', ""How did Gopani-Kufa's family feel when they moved into the palace?"", 'How was Gopani-Kufa now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles?', 'How did Shasasa feel when her father entrusted the mirror to her?']","['Who did Gopani-Kufa entrust the mirror to?', 'Who was now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles?', 'Who did Gopani-Kufa entrust the Mirror to?', 'Who did Shasasa entrust the mirror to?']","['Why did Gopani-Kufa entrust Sipao the Mirror to his daughter?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa tell his daughter the whole secret?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa and his family move to the palace?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa want Shasasa to dwell apart?']","['Where did Gopani-Kufa move his family to?', 'Where did Gopani-Kufa move to?', 'Where did Gopani-Kufa live?', 'Where did Shasasa move to?']","['When did Gopani-Kufa and his family move into the palace?', 'When did Gopani-Kufa entrust the mirror to Shasasa?', 'When was Gopani-Kufa as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles?', 'When did Gopani-Kufa tell his daughter the whole secret?']","['Which palace did Gopani-Kufa and his family move to?', 'Which daughter did Gopani-Kufa entrust the mirror to?', 'Which daughter did Gopani-Kufa entrust the Mirror to?', 'Which princess did Gopani-Kufa entrust the mirror to?']"
"Then Shasasa took the Magic Mirror and hid it beneath her pillow, and after that for many years Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once did he need to ask Sipao to grant him a wish.  Now it happened that, after many years, when the hair of Gopani-Kufa was turning grey with age, there came white men to that country.  Up the Zambesi they came, and they fought long and fiercely with Gopani-Kufa; but, because of the power of the Magic Mirror, he beat them, and they fled to the sea-coast.  Chief among them was one Rei, a man of much cunning, who sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power.  So one day he called to him a trusty servant named Butou, and said: 'Go you to the town and find out for me what is the secret of its greatness.'","[""What did Rei do to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power?"", 'What did Shasasa do with the mirror?', 'What happened because of the power of the Magic Mirror?', 'What did Shasasa hide the Magic Mirror under?']","['How did Gopani-Kufa rule his people?', ""How did Rei discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power?"", 'How did Gopani-Kufa defeat the white men?', 'How did Shasasa hide the mirror?']","[""Who did Rei send to find out the secret of the mirror's greatness?"", 'Who was chief among the white men?', 'Who did Shasasa hide the mirror under?', 'Who fought long and fiercely with Gopani-Kufa?']","[""Why did Rei seek to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power?"", 'Why did the white men flee to the sea-coast?', 'Why did Gopani-Kufa rule his people well and wisely?', 'Why did Shasasa hide the mirror?']","['Where did the white men flee to?', 'Where did Rei tell Butou to go?', 'Where did the white men go?', 'Where did Rei go to find out the secret of the mirror?']","['When did the white men flee to the sea-coast?', 'When was Gopani-Kufa turning grey with age?', 'When did Rei go to the town and find out the secret of the mirror?', 'When did Shasasa hide the mirror?']","[""Which man sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power?"", 'Which servant did Gopani-Kufa ask for a wish?', 'Which servant did Gopani-Kufa send to the town?', 'Which one of the white men was chief among them?']"
"In this way the end came.  For the heart of Shasasa, the daughter of Gopani-Kufa, went forth to Butou the traitor, and from her he learnt the secret of the Magic Mirror.  One night, when all the town slept, he felt beneath her pillow and, finding the Mirror, he stole it and fled back with it to Rei, the chief of the white men.  So it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was gazing up at the river from a window of the palace he again saw the war-canoes of the white men; and at the sight his spirit misgave him.

So she rode on the bear's back, far, far away, until at last they came to a great rock. There the bear knocked, and at once a door opened through which they entered a great castle, with many brilliantly lighted rooms, where everything gleamed with gold and silver. Then they came into a great hall, and there stood a table completely covered with the most splendid dishes. Here the white bear gave the maiden a silver bell, and said that if there were anything she wanted, she need only ring the bell, and she should have it at once. And after the maiden had eaten, and evening came on, she felt like lying down and going to sleep. So she rang her bell.

"Yet when she had lain down and put out the light, she saw a man come in and cast himself down in a corner. It was the white bear, who was allowed to throw off his fur at night. The maiden never actually saw him, for he never came until she had put out the light. Before dawn brightened he had disappeared again.  For a time all went well; but gradually the maiden grew sad and silent. She had not a soul to keep her company the live-long day, and she felt very homesick for her parents and sisters.

The daughter took the candle-end and hid it in her wimple, and in the evening the white bear came to fetch her.

"When they reached home, and the maiden had gone to bed, all went as usual: a man came in and cast himself down in a corner of the room.

"When the maiden awoke the next morning, the prince as well as the castle had disappeared.

And when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and had cried her fill, she set out and wandered many, many days, until at last she came to a great hill. And before the hill sat an old woman who was playing with a golden apple. The maiden asked the woman whether she did not know which road led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose three yards long.

"""So you are that girl,"" said the woman. ""Well, my child, I am sorry to say that all I know of him is that he lives in the castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse, on which you may ride to my neighbor, and perhaps she can tell you. And when you get there just give the horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to go home. And here, take this golden apple along!""  The maiden mounted the horse, and rode a long, long time. At length she again came to a hill, before which sat an old woman with a golden reel. The maiden asked whether she could not tell her the road which led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. This woman said just what the other had, no, she knew no more of the castle than that it lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ""And,"" said she, ""you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse to ride to the nearest neighbor. Perhaps she can tell you.

"The maiden then mounted the horse, and again rode a long, long time. At length she once more came to a great hill, before which sat an old woman spinning at a golden spindle. Then the maiden once more asked after the prince, and the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. And everything happened exactly as on the two previous occasions.  ""Do you happen to be the maiden the prince wanted to marry?"" asked the old woman.  ""Yes, I am that maiden,"" answered the maiden.  But this old woman knew no more about the road than the two others. ""Yes, the castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon, that I know,"" said she. ""And you will probably never get there. But I will loan you my horse, and you may ride on it to the East Wind and ask him. Perhaps he is acquainted there, and can blow you thither.

"Early the next morning the North Wind awakened the maiden. Then he blew himself up, and made himself so large and thick that he was quite horrible to look at. Thereupon they rushed along through the air as though they meant to reach the end of the world at once. And everywhere beneath them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out by the roots, and houses torn down. As they rushed across the sea, ships foundered by the hundreds.

"""Are you afraid?"" asked the North Wind.  ""No, not at all,"" answered the maiden. By now they were not far distant from the land.

"That day the maiden again sat beneath the windows of the castle, and wound her golden reel. And all went as on the preceding day. The princess asked what she wanted for the reel, and the maiden answered that she would sell it neither for gold nor for money. If she might speak that night to the prince, then she would give the reel to the princess. Yet when the maiden came to the prince, he was again fast asleep, and no matter how much she wept and wailed, and cried and shook, she could not wake him. But as soon as day dawned, and it grew bright, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out. And that day the maiden again seated herself beneath the windows of the castle, and spun with her golden spindle. Of course, the princess with the long nose wanted to have that, too. She opened the window, and asked what she wanted for the golden spindle. The maiden replied, as she had twice before, that she would sell the spindle neither for gold nor money. The princess could have it if she might speak to the prince again that night. Yes, that she was welcome to do, said the princess, and took the golden spindle. Now it happened that some Christians, who were captives in the castle, and quartered in a room beside that of the prince, had heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the prince's room for the past two nights. So they told the prince. And that evening when the princess came to him with his night-cap, the prince pretended to drink it. He instead poured it out behind his back, for he could well imagine that she had put a sleeping-powder into the cup. Then, when the maiden came in, the prince was awake, and she had to tell him just how she had found the castle.","['What did the princess with the long nose want for the golden spindle?', 'What did the prince do when the princess came in with the night-cap?', 'What did the princess with the long nose do as soon as day dawned?', 'What did the princess with the long nose do when she saw the maiden?']","['How did the prince feel when he saw the woman weeping and wailing?', 'How did the princess with the long nose feel when she saw the golden spindle?', 'How did the prince feel when he heard the woman weeping and wailing?', ""How did the princess with the long nose feel when she saw the maiden's golden reel?""]","[""Who heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the prince's room?"", 'Who had heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the castle?', 'Who were captives in the castle?', 'Who wanted the golden spindle?']","['Why did the prince pour sleeping-powder into the cup?', 'Why did the prince pretend to drink the sleeping-powder?', 'Why did the princess with the long nose want the spindle?', ""Why couldn't the maiden wake up the prince?""]","['Where did the princess with the long nose drive the maiden?', 'Where did the princess with the long nose live?', 'Where did some Christians hear a woman weeping and wailing?', 'Where did the princess with long nose live?']","['When did the princess with the long nose drive the maiden out?', 'When did the prince pretend to drink the sleeping-powder?', 'When did the princess with the long nose come?', 'When did the princess with the long nose arrive?']","['Which princess with the long nose wanted the golden reel?', 'Which princess wanted the golden spindle?', 'Which princess did the maiden want to marry?', 'Which princess had heard the woman weeping and wailing?']"

"Well, that would not be much of a task, said the women, and agreed to the proposal. And the princess with the long nose at once began to wash. She washed with all her might and main, and took the greatest pains, but the longer she washed and rubbed, the larger grew the spots.  ""O, you don""t know how to wash!"" said her mother, the old troll-wife. ""Just give it to me!"" But no sooner had she taken the shirt in her hand, than it began to look worse, and the more she washed and rubbed, the larger and blacker grew the spots. Then the other troll-women had to come and wash. The longer they washed the shirt the uglier it grew, and finally it looked as though it had been hanging in the smokestack.","['What did the other troll-women have to do when the princess did not want to wash?', 'What did the princess with the long nose do when she first began to wash?', 'What happened the longer the troll-women washed the shirt?', 'What did the princess with the long nose do when she was asked to wash the shirt?']","['How did the other troll-women feel when they had to wash the shirt?', 'How did the princess with the long nose feel when the spots grew larger?', 'How did the other troll-women feel when they had to come and wash the shirt?', 'How did the princess with the long nose feel when the spots grew larger and blacker?']","['Who had to come and wash the shirt?', 'Who did not know how to wash?', 'Who did the princess with the long nose ask to wash her shirt?', 'Who did the troll-women ask to wash the shirt?']","['Why did the other troll-women have to come and wash?', 'Why did the princess with the long nose not know how to wash?', 'Why did the princess with the long nose begin to wash?', 'Why did the princess with the long nose want to wash the shirt?']","['Where did the spots come from?', 'Where did the troll-women wash the shirt?', 'Where did the other troll-women come to wash?', 'Where did the spots grow?']","['When did the princess with the long nose begin to wash?', 'When did the other troll-women come and wash the shirt?', 'When did the other troll-women have to come and wash?', 'When did the spots grow larger and blacker?']","['Which troll-wife had to come and wash the shirt?', 'Which troll-wife did not know how to wash?', 'Which troll-women had to come and wash the shirt?', 'Which troll-wife was the first to come and wash?']"

When the ship is in danger the first talisman is burnt, and help comes. But if this is of no avail, then the second and finally the third picture is burned.

"When seamen lose their course among wind and waves and darkling clouds, they pray devoutly to the Queen of Heaven. Then a red lantern appears on the face of the waters.

"A wooden wand is always kept before her holy picture in the cabin. It often happens that the fish-dragons play in the seas. They are two giant fish who spout up water against one another till the sun in the sky is obscured, and the seas are shrouded in profound darkness. And often, in the distance, one may see a bright opening in the darkness. If the ship holds a course straight for this opening it will win through, and is suddenly floating in calm waters again. Looking back, one may see the two fishes still spouting water, and the ship will have passed directly beneath their jaws. But a storm is always near when the fish dragons swim; therefore it is well to burn paper or wool so that the dragons do not draw the ship down into the depths. Or the Master of the Wand may burn incense before the wand in the cabin. Then he must take the wand and swing it over the water three times, in a circle.

"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the South of Scotland, near the Border. It was not very far from Longtown. He was known as Canonbie Dick. As he went up and down the country, he almost always had a long string of horses behind him. He bought them at one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big penny by the transaction.  He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. The people who knew him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one else need be asked to do it.  One evening, he was returning from a fair at some distance from his home with a pair of horses which he had not succeeded in selling. He was riding over Bowden Moor, which lies to the west of the Eildon Hills. These hills are, as all men know, the scene of some of the most famous of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies. Also, so men say, they are the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights, who rest under the three high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them.","['What happened when Canonbie Dick went up and down the country?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do with his horses?', 'What were the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights?', 'What was the name of a certain horse-dealer?']","['How did Canonbie Dick always have a long string of horses behind him?', 'How did Canonbie Dick make a good big penny by the transaction?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel about being a horse-dealer?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel about riding over Bowden Moor?']","['Who were resting under the three high peaks, waiting for the mystic call?', 'Who was a certain horse-dealer?', 'Who lived in the South of Scotland?', 'Who were the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights?']","['Why did Canonbie Dick have a long string of horses behind him?', 'Why was Canonbie Dick riding over Bowden Moor?', 'Why was Canonbie Dick not easily daunted?', 'Why did Canonbie Dick always have a long string of horses behind him?']","['Where was Canonbie Dick riding over?', 'Where did a certain horse-dealer live?', 'Where did Canonbie Dick live?', 'Where did Canonbie Dick ride over?']","['When was Canonbie Dick riding over Bowden Moor?', 'When was Canonbie Dick returning from a fair?', 'When did Canonbie Dick live?', 'When did Canonbie Dick ride over Bowden Moor?']","['Which horse-dealer lived in the South of Scotland?', 'Which horse-dealer had a long string of horses behind him?', 'Which horse-dealer was Canonbie Dick?', ""Which hills were the scene of some of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies?""]"
"But little recked the horse-dealer of Arthur and his Knights, nor yet of Thomas the Rhymer. He was riding along at a snail's pace, thinking over the bargains which he had made at the fair that day. He was wondering when he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses.  All at once he was startled by the approach of a venerable man, with white hair and an old-world dress, who seemed almost to start out of the ground, so suddenly did he make his appearance.  When they met, the stranger stopped. To Canonbie Dick's great amazement, asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his horses.","['What did Canonbie Dick do while he was riding over Bowden Moor?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do while he was riding along?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do as he was riding along?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do while he was riding towards the fair?']","['How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw Thomas the Rhymer?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw the stranger?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw the man?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw the venerable man?']","['Who was the man with white hair and an old-world dress?', 'Who did Canonbie Dick meet when he was riding along?', 'Who did Canonbie Dick meet?', 'Who had white hair and an old-world dress?']","['Why was Canonbie Dick surprised by the approach of a venerable man?', ""Why was Canonbie Dick riding at a snail's pace?"", 'Why did Canonbie Dick think over the bargains he had made at the fair?', ""Why did Canonbie Dick's two remaining horses need to be sold?""]","['Where was Canonbie Dick riding?', 'Where did Canonbie Dick ride to?', 'Where was Canonbie Dick?', 'Where was Canonbie Dick riding to?']","['When did Canonbie Dick meet Thomas the Rhymer?', 'When was Canonbie Dick wondering about how to dispose of his two remaining horses?', 'When did Thomas the Rhymer make his appearance?', 'When did Thomas the Rhymer approach Canonbie Dick?']","['Which horse-dealer did Canonbie Dick meet?', 'Which man did Canonbie Dick meet when he was riding along?', ""Which one of Canonbie Dick's two remaining horses was his?"", 'Which stranger did Canonbie Dick meet when he was riding along?']"
"The wily horse-dealer thought that he saw a chance of driving a good bargain. The stranger looked a man of some consequence; so he named a good round sum.  The old man tried to bargain with him; but when he found that he had not much chance of succeeding. No one ever did succeed in inducing Canonbie Dick to sell a horse for a less sum than he named for it at first. He agreed to buy the animals, and, pulling a bag of gold from the pocket of his queerly cut breeches. He began to count out the price.  As he did so, Canonbie Dick got another shock of surprise. The gold that the stranger gave him was not the gold that was in use at the time, but was fashioned into Unicorns, and Bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins. It would be of no use to the horse-dealer in his everyday transactions. But it was good, pure gold. He took it gladly. He knew that he was selling his horses at about half as much again as they were worth.

"Then the two parted, but not before the old man had commissioned Dick to get him other good horses at the same price. The only stipulation he made being that Dick should always bring them to the same spot, after dark, and that he should always come alone.  And, as time went on, the horse-dealer found that he had indeed met a good customer.  For, whenever he came across a suitable horse, he had only to lead it over Bowden Moor after dark. He was sure to meet the mysterious, white-headed stranger, who always paid him for the animal in old-fashioned golden pieces.

"Canonbie Dick was apt to get very thirsty. His ordinary customers, knowing this, took care always to provide him with something to drink. The old man never did so.

"After the first yard or two they were enveloped in thick darkness. The horse-dealer would have been sore put to it to keep near his guide had not the latter held out his hand for him to grasp. But after a little space a faint glimmering of light began to appear, which grew clearer and clearer. At last they found themselves in an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in sconces in the rocky walls. Although they served to give light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast apartment.  And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would find in a stable. In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.  But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them.

"When they reached this table the stranger turned to him. He said, with great dignity, ""Thou hast heard, good man, of Thomas of Ercildoune--Thomas the Rhymer, as men call him. He who went to dwell for a time with the Queen of Fairy-land, and from her received the Gifts of Truth and Prophecy?""  Canonbie Dick nodded; for as the wonderful Soothsayer's name fell on his ears, his heart sank within him and his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth. If he had been brought there to parley with Thomas the Rhymer, then had he laid himself open to all the eldrich Powers of Darkness.  ""I that speak to you am he,"" went on the white-haired stranger. ""And I have permitted thee thus to have thy desire and follow me hither in order that I may try of what stuff thou art made. Before thee lies a Horn and a Sword.

"Now Dick was more versed in giving blows than in making music. His first impulse was to seize the Sword, then, come what might, he had something in his hand to defend himself with. But just as he was about to lift it the thought struck him that, if the place were full of spirits, as he felt sure that it must be, this action of him might be taken to mean defiance. This might cause them to band themselves together against him.  So, changing his mind, he picked up the Horn with a trembling hand. He blew a blast upon it, which, however, was so weak and feeble that it could scarce be heard at the other end of the hall.  The result that followed was enough to appal the stoutest heart. Thunder rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall. The charmed Knights and their horses woke in an instant from their enchanted sleep. The Knights sprang to their feet and seized their swords, brandishing them round their heads. Their great black chargers stamped, and snorted, and ground their bits, as if eager to escape from their stalls. And where a moment before all had been stillness and silence, there was now a scene of wild din and excitement.","['What did the Knights do when they woke up from their enchanted sleep?', 'What happened after Dick first tried to pick up the Sword?', 'What did the horses do when they woke up?', 'What did the Knights do when they woke up?']","['How did the Knights feel when they woke up from their enchanted sleep?', 'How did the horses feel when they woke up from their enchanted sleep?', 'How did the Knights feel when they woke up?', 'How did Dick feel when he picked up the Horn?']","['Who did Dick choose instead of the Sword?', 'Who was more versed in giving blows than in making music?', 'Who woke up from their enchanted sleep?', 'Who woke up in an instant from their enchanted sleep?']","['Why was there a scene of wild din and excitement?', 'Why did Dick choose the Horn?', ""Why didn't Dick choose the Sword?"", 'Why did Dick choose the Horn instead of the Sword?']","['Where did the Knights and their horses wake up from their enchanted sleep?', 'Where did the horses go when they woke up?', 'Where was there a scene of wild din and excitement?', 'Where did the horses want to escape?']","['When did the Knights wake up from their enchanted sleep?', 'When did the horses wake up from their enchanted sleep?', 'When was there a scene of wild din and excitement?', 'When did the Knights and their horses wake up?']","['Which instrument did Dick choose?', 'Which instrument was Dick more versed in?', 'Which instrument did Dick choose instead of the Sword?', 'Which weapon did Dick choose?']"
"Now was the time for Canonbie Dick to play the man. If he had done so all the rest of his life might have been different.  But his courage failed him, and he lost his chance. Terrified at seeing so many threatening faces turned towards him, he dropped the Horn. He made one weak, undecided effort to pick up the Sword.  But, ere he could do so, a mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in the hall. These were the words that it uttered:      ""Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,     Who did not draw the Sword before he blew the Horn.""  And, before Dick knew what he was about, a perfect whirlwind of cold, raw air tore through the cavern, carrying the luckless horse-dealer along with it. Hurrying him along the narrow passage through which he had entered, dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and shale. He fell right to the bottom. He was found, with little life left in him, next morning, by some shepherds, He had just strength enough left to whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure.","['What happened after Canonbie Dick tried to pick up the Sword?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do when he was found the next morning?', 'What did Canonbie Dick try to do after he dropped the Horn?', 'What did Canonbie Dick do the next morning?']","['How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw the threatening faces turned towards him?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw so many threatening faces?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel when he saw the threatening faces?', 'How did Canonbie Dick feel after he saw the threatening faces?']","['Who did Canonbie Dick fail to draw before he blew the Horn?', 'Who heard Canonbie Dick try to pick up the Sword?', 'Who did Canonbie Dick meet the next morning?', 'Who did Canonbie Dick meet in the hall?']","['Why did Canonbie Dick lose his courage?', 'Why did Canonbie Dick try to pick up the Sword?', 'Why did Canonbie Dick drop the Horn?', 'Why did Canonbie Dick whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure?']","['Where was Canonbie Dick after he dropped the Horn?', 'Where did Canonbie Dick fall to?', 'Where was Canonbie Dick found the next morning?', 'Where did Canonbie Dick fall?']","['When did Canonbie Dick lose his courage?', 'When was Canonbie Dick found the next morning?', 'When did Canonbie Dick lose his strength?', 'When did Canonbie Dick drop the Horn?']","['Which horse-dealer did Canonbie Dick lose along with?', 'Which man did Canonbie Dick try to kill with the Sword?', 'Which horse-dealer did Canonbie Dick lose?', 'Which mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in the hall?']"
"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast, and supported themselves by fishing. They had only one child, a son, who was their pride and joy, and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long, and never felt tired or discontented with their lot. This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up.' But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks, and as he was really very clever in managing a boat, the old people were very seldom anxious about him.","[""What was Uraschimataro's name?"", ""What did Uraschimataro's name mean in Japanese?"", ""What did Uraschimataro's parents do for his sake?"", 'What did Uraschimataro do because he was a fine well-grown youth?']","['How did Uraschimataro sail the boat?', 'How did Uraschimataro manage the boat?', 'How did Uraschimataro fish?', 'How did Uraschimataro catch fish?']","[""Who was the couple's pride and joy?"", 'Who was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman?', 'Who was Uraschimataro?', 'Who was not the bravest sailor in the whole village?']","['Why was Uraschimataro a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman?', 'Why were the old people seldom anxious about Uraschimataro?', 'Why did the old couple never feel tired or discontented with their lot?', 'Why was Uraschimataro not the bravest sailor in the whole village?']","['Where did Uraschimataro live?', 'Where did Uraschimataro fish?', 'Where did the old couple live?', 'Where did the couple live?']","['When was Uraschimataro born?', 'When did Uraschimataro venture so far out to sea?', 'When was Uraschimataro a fine well-grown youth?', 'When did Uraschimataro venture out to sea?']","['Which son was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman?', 'Which name did Uraschimataro have?', 'Which boat did Uraschimataro master?', ""Which child was the couple's pride and joy?""]"
"One beautiful bright morning, as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat, he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle. He was delighted with his prize, and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home, when suddenly the turtle found its voice, and tremblingly begged for its life. 'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer. Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude.'  Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea.","['What did Uraschimataro see lying among the fishes?', 'What did Uraschimataro do when the turtle trembingly begged for its life?', 'What did Uraschimataro do when the turtle trembingly begged for his life?', 'What did Uraschimataro do when the tiny little turtle asked for its life?']","['How did Uraschimataro feel when he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle?', 'How did Uraschimataro feel after he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle?', 'How will Uraschimataro feel when the turtle begs for its life?', 'How will Uraschimataro feel when the turtle trembingly begs for its life?']","['Who did Uraschimataro see lying among the fishes?', 'Who was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat?', 'Who did Uraschimataro find lying among the fishes?', 'Who did Uraschimataro throw the turtle into?']","['Why did Uraschimataro want to set the turtle free?', 'Why did Uraschimataro put the turtle back into the sea?', 'Why did Uraschimataro want to keep the turtle?', 'Why did Uraschimataro throw the turtle into a wooden vessel?']","['Where did Uraschimataro throw the turtle?', 'Where did Uraschimataro keep the turtle till he got home?', 'Where did Uraschimataro throw the tiny little turtle?', 'Where did Uraschimataro keep the tiny little turtle?']","['When did Uraschimataro find the tiny little turtle?', 'When did Uraschimataro find a tiny little turtle?', 'When was Uraschimataro hauling his well-filled nets?', 'When did the turtle plead for its life?']","['Which turtle did Uraschimataro see lying among the fishes?', 'Which turtle trembingly begged Uraschimataro to let it go?', 'Which turtle did Uraschimataro find lying among the fishes?', 'Which turtle did Uraschimataro throw into a wooden vessel?']"
"Years flew by, and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea. But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves. Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate. But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore. Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: 'I am the turtle whose life you once saved. I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude. The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there. Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will.' Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend's help. But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell, when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once, but go under the sea, and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there.","['What happened because Uraschimataro was a powerful swimmer?', 'What did the turtle do when Uraschimataro struggled hard to reach the shore?', 'What did Uraschimataro do every morning?', ""What happened to Uraschimataro's boat when she was shattered to pieces?""]","['How did Uraschimataro feel when his boat shattered to pieces?', 'How did Uraschimataro feel when he struggled hard to reach the shore?', 'How did Uraschimataro feel when the boat shattered to pieces?', 'How will Uraschimataro feel when the turtle helps him?']","['Who saved Uraschimataro?', 'Who came towards Uraschimataro?', 'Who was the large turtle?', 'Who was a powerful swimmer?']","['Why did Uraschimataro struggle hard to reach the shore?', 'Why did Uraschimataro sail his boat into the deep sea?', ""Why didn't Uraschimataro return to the shore at once?"", 'Why did the turtle offer to help Uraschimataro?']","['Where did Uraschimataro sail his boat to?', 'Where did Uraschimataro sail his boat to every morning?', 'Where did Uraschimataro sail to every morning?', 'Where did Uraschimataro sail to?']","['When did Uraschimataro sail his boat?', 'When did Uraschimataro sail his boat into the deep sea?', 'When did Uraschimataro almost drown?', 'When did Uraschimataro sail his boat to the deep sea?']","['Which turtle came towards Uraschimataro?', 'Which turtle offered to help Uraschimataro?', 'Which boat was shattered to pieces?', 'Which turtle offered to take Uraschimataro to land?']"
"Uraschimataro agreed willingly, and in another moment they were deep, deep down, with fathoms of blue water above their heads. Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls. But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside, he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within, which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales.  'Where have you brought me?' he asked his guide in a low voice.  'To the palace of Ringu, the house of the sea god, whose subjects we all are,' answered the turtle. 'I am the first waiting maid of his daughter, the lovely princess Otohime, whom you will shortly see.'","['What did the princess do at the palace of Ringu?', ""What happened after Uraschimataro agreed to the turtle's request?"", 'What did Uraschimataro do while the turtle took him to the palace?', 'What did Uraschimataro see when he entered the palace?']","['How did Uraschimataro feel when the turtle took him to the palace?', 'How long did it take Uraschimataro to reach the palace of Ringu?', 'How did Uraschimataro feel when he saw the palace?', 'How did Uraschimataro feel when the turtle told him where he was going?']","['Who was the maid of the lovely princess Otohime?', 'Who was the first waiting maid of Ringu?', 'Who did Uraschimataro meet at the palace?', 'Who was the house of the sea god?']","['Why was the maiden the first waiting maid of the lovely princess Otohime?', 'Why did Uraschimataro agree to go with the turtle?', 'Why did Uraschimataro ask where the turtle brought him?', 'Why was Uraschimataro astonished when he saw the palace?']","['Where did the turtle take Uraschimataro?', 'Where did Uraschimataro and the turtle stop?', 'Where did the turtle take Uraschimataro to?', 'Where was the palace of Ringu?']","['When did Uraschimataro arrive at the palace?', 'When did Uraschimataro reach the palace?', 'When did Uraschimataro arrive at the palace of Ringu?', 'When did the turtle take Uraschimataro to the palace of Ringu?']","['Which palace did the turtle take Uraschimataro to?', 'Which princess was the first waiting maid of Ringu?', 'Which was the house of the sea god?', 'Which princess did the turtle bring Uraschimataro to?']"
"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him, that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next. But the turtle, who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him, went at once to make known his arrival. And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade. 'Is not that reward enough?' she asked, smiling, looking all the while as fair as the sun itself. And Uraschimataro said 'Yes,' and so he stayed there. For how long? That he only knew later.","['What did the princess do when she saw Uraschimataro?', 'What did Uraschimataro do while he waited for the princess?', 'What did the princess promise Uraschimataro?', 'What did Uraschimataro do because he was so puzzled?']","[""How did Uraschimataro feel when he arrived at the princess's palace?"", 'How did the princess feel when she saw Uraschimataro?', ""How did Uraschimataro feel after he arrived at the princess's palace?"", ""How did Uraschimataro feel when he arrived at the princess's castle?""]","['Who wished to see Uraschimataro?', 'Who wanted Uraschimataro to stay with him?', 'Who had talked so much of Uraschimataro to the princess?', 'Who wanted to see Uraschimataro?']","['Why did Uraschimataro stay with the princess?', 'Why did the princess want Uraschimataro to stay with her?', 'Why did the princess wish to see Uraschimataro?', 'Why did Uraschimataro wait in a dazed condition?']","['Where did Uraschimataro stay?', 'Where did Uraschimataro stay with the princess?', 'Where did Uraschimataro stay for a while?', 'Where did the princess tell Uraschimataro to stay?']","[""When Uraschimataro arrived at the princess's palace?"", ""When did Uraschimataro arrive at the princess's palace?"", 'When did Uraschimataro stay with the princess?', ""When did Uraschimataro arrive at the princess's castle?""]","['Which princess wished to see Uraschimataro?', 'Which princess wanted Uraschimataro to stay with her?', 'Which princess had a wish to see Uraschimataro?', 'Which princess wanted Uraschimataro to be her husband?']"
"I will do anything that will bring me back to you,' exclaimed Uraschimataro, looking at her tenderly, but the princess was silent: she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more. Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. 'If you can do this,' she said as she bade him farewell, 'your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore, and will carry you back to me.'  Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess. Three days and three nights they swam through the sea, and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home.

"His life passed by, and each hour seemed happier than the last, when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents. He fought against it hard, knowing how it would grieve the princess, but it grew on him stronger and stronger, till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong. Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home, and that he must see his parents once more. The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. 'You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more,' she moaned bitterly. But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, 'Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever.'

"Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps. He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.  Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.  Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old.

"There was once an old man and his wife, who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn. They were a very canty and contented couple, for they had enough to live on, and enough to do. Indeed, they considered themselves quite rich, for, besides their cottage and their garden, they possessed two sleek cows, five hens and a cock, an old cat, and two kittens.  The old man spent his time looking after the cows, and the hens, and the garden; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning.  One day, just after breakfast, the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening, so she took down her bakeboard, and put on her girdle, and baked a couple of fine cakes, and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden.","['What did the old man and his wife have?', 'What did the old man and his wife consider themselves?', 'What did the old man and his wife do in their cottage?', 'What did the old man do in the cottage?']","['How many animals did the old man and his wife have?', 'How did the old man and his wife feel about being able to live on?', 'How did the old man and his wife feel about their lives?', 'How did the old man and his wife feel about their life?']","['Who did the couple have besides their cottage and their garden?', 'Who was a very canty and contented couple?', 'Who did the old man and his wife live with?', 'Who looked after the cows, hens, and the garden?']","['Why did the old man and his wife consider themselves quite rich?', 'Why was the couple a very canty and contented couple?', 'Why did the old woman bake a couple of fine cakes?', 'Why did the old woman think she would like an oatmeal bannock?']","['Where did the old man and woman live?', 'Where did the old man and wife live?', 'Where did the man and his wife live?', 'Where did the man and woman live?']","['When did the old woman bake a couple of fine cakes?', 'When did the old man and his wife consider themselves quite rich?', 'When did the old man and his wife live?', 'When did the wife bake a couple of fine cakes?']","['Which couple lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn?', 'Which animal did the couple have besides their cottage and their garden?', 'Which one of the couple decided to eat an oatmeal bannock?', 'Which one of the old man looked after the cows, and the hens?']"
"While they were toasting, her husband came in from the byre, and sat down to take a rest in his great arm-chair. Presently his eyes fell on the bannocks, and, as they looked very good, he broke one through the middle and began to eat it.  When the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate, so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could. And when the old woman saw it disappearing, she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her, holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other.  But she was old, and the bannock was young, and it ran faster than she did, and escaped over the hill behind the house. It ran, and it ran, and it ran, until it came to a large newly thatched cottage, and, as the door was open, it took refuge inside, and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire, which was burning in the first room that it came to.","['What did the husband do when he came in from the byre?', 'What did the other bannock do when it saw the old woman run after it?', 'What did the husband do while they were toasting?', 'What did the husband do when he saw the bannocks?']","['How did the other bannock feel when it saw its wife run away?', 'How did the husband feel when he saw the bannocks?', 'How did the other bannock feel when it saw the old woman run away?', 'How did the other bannock feel when it saw the old woman run after it?']","['Who did the husband eat while they were toasting?', 'Who ran faster than the other bannock?', 'Who ran after the other bannock?', 'Who came in from the byre?']","['Why did the husband eat one of the bannocks?', 'Why did the other bannock run away?', 'Why did the woman run after the bannock?', 'Why did the bannock run away?']","['Where did the other bannock run to?', 'Where did the bannock run to?', 'Where did the bannock take refuge?', 'Where did the bannock escape to?']","['When did the husband eat one of the bannocks?', 'When the other bannock saw the old woman run after it?', 'When did the other bannock run out of the door?', 'When did the bannock escape?']","['Which bannock did not have a good disposition?', 'Which bannock ran faster than the old woman?', 'Which bannock did not want to be the one to die?', 'Which bannock escaped over the hill?']"
"Now, it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor, and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross-legged on the top of a big table by the window, sewing away with all their might, while the tailor's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint.

"So she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards, and the tailor jumped up with his great shears, and one apprentice grasped the line measure, while another took up the saucer full of pins; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock.

It ran too quickly for him, however, and at last he stopped and went back to the house, while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside.

"""If there be one thing I am fond of, it is a glass of ale and a well-toasted cake,"" he cried. ""So come inside here, and welcome to you.""

After this the bannock came to a farmhouse, with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it. In it went, and ran to the fireside.

"This time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather.  Here the Goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire, and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow.  ""Oh, Jock! come here, come here,"" cried the Goodwife. ""You are crying for a little bannock for your supper; come here, histie, quick, and help me to catch it.""

"So Jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair; but, in his hurry, he tripped and fell, and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door.  Through the whins and up the hillside it ran, and over the top of the hill, to a shepherd's cottage on the other side.  The inmates were just sitting down to their porridge, and the Goodwife was scraping the pan.  ""Save us and help us,"" she exclaimed, stopping with the spoon half-way to her mouth.

"But the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit.

And when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could, he threw his bonnet at it, and almost struck it; but it escaped all these dangers, and soon it came to another house, where the folk were just going to bed.

"There was once upon a time a King who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that you couldn't find anyone like her in the world. It happened that she fell ill, and when she felt that she must soon die, she sent for the King, and said, 'If you want to marry after my death, make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as I am, and has just such golden hair as I have. Promise me this.' After the King had promised her this, she closed her eyes and died.  For a long time the King was not to be comforted, and he did not even think of taking a second wife. At last his councillors said, 'The King must marry again, so that we may have a queen.' So messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late Queen in beauty.

The King, however, was not to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she determined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping, she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made her face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God, and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep.","[""What did the Princess do when she saw there was no hope of changing her father's resolution?"", 'What did the King command the maidens to weave?', 'What did the Princess do when everyone else was sleeping?', 'What did the King command the maidens to do?']","[""How did the Princess feel when she saw her father's resolution was complete?"", ""How did the Princess feel when she saw her father's resolution was fulfilled?"", ""How did the Princess feel when she saw her father's resolution?"", ""How did the Princess feel after she realized her father's resolution was fulfilled?""]","['Who did the King ask to weave three dresses?', 'Who did the King command to weave the three dresses?', 'Who did the Princess command to weave the three dresses?', 'Who did the Princess ask to make a cloak out of?']","['Why did the youngest Princess flee away?', 'Why did the youngest Princess want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin?', 'Why did the youngest Princess decide to flee away?', 'Why did the King command the maidens to weave three dresses?']","['Where did the youngest Princess go to after she fled away?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to when she wanted a cloak?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to after she finished her shopping?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to rest?']","['When all was ready, the King commanded the maidens to weave three dresses?', 'When did the Princess flee away?', 'When did the Princess decide to flee away?', 'When did the cloak come to the King?']","[""Which of the Princess's three dresses will be as golden as the sun?"", ""Which one of the Princess's three requests was fulfilled?"", ""Which of the Princess's three treasures did she take?"", ""Which one of the Princess's three dresses would be as golden as the sun?""]"
"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon. Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and round it, barking. The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a wild beast is in there.' The huntsmen went in, and then came back and said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't know, and we have never seen one like it; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur; but it is lying down asleep.' The King said, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take it with us.' When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.' Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come with us and sweep the ashes together.' So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace. There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.  So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty. Ah, beautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now?","['What was the Many-furred Creature sent to do in the kitchen?', ""What did the king's dogs do when they came to the tree?"", 'What did the huntsmen say they saw in the hollow tree?', 'What did the king order the huntsmen to do with the animal?']","['How did the Many-furred Creature feel when the huntsmen seized her?', 'How will the maiden feel when the huntsmen try to catch the wild beast?', 'How will the maiden feel when the huntsmen try to catch the animal?', 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she woke up?']","['Who was hunting in the wood?', 'Who was hunting in the hollow tree?', 'Who did the king send to find the animal?', 'Who was hunting in the woods?']","['Why was the Many-furred Creature sent to the kitchen?', 'Why did the king order the huntsmen to catch the wild beast?', ""Why did the king's dogs sniff the tree?"", 'Why was the maiden in great poverty?']","['Where was the Many-furred Creature sent to?', 'Where did the king and the huntsmen take the animal?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature live?', 'Where did the many-furred creature live?']","['When was the Many-furred Creature sent to the kitchen?', ""When the king's dogs come to the tree?"", 'When did the Many-furred Creature live?', 'When did the king find the wild beast?']","['Which animal did the king find in the hollow tree?', 'Which animal did the huntsmen find in the hollow tree?', 'Which animal did the king hunt in the wood?', 'Which animal was in the hollow tree?']"
"It happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace, that she said to the cook, 'Can I go upstairs for a little bit and look on? I will stand outside the doors.' The cook replied, 'Yes, you can go up, but in half-an-hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes.' Then she took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off her fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud. Then she opened the nut, and took out the dress as golden as the sun. And when she had done this, she went up to the feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and they thought she must be a King's daughter. But the King came towards her and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My eyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' When the dance was ended, she curtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared, no one knew whither. The guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned, but no one had seen her.","['What did the cook need to do in half-an-hour?', 'What did the princess do before going up to the feast?', 'What did everyone do when the princess came to the feast?', 'What did the cook ask the princess to do?']","['How did the cook feel when the Princess asked to go upstairs and look on?', 'How did everyone feel when the Princess came to the feast?', 'How did the cook feel when the Princess asked to go upstairs?', 'How did the King feel when he saw the Princess?']","['Who did the Princess ask to go upstairs for a little bit?', ""Who stepped out of the Princess's way?"", 'Who did the cook tell to be back in half an hour?', 'Who did the Princess turn out to be?']","[""Why did everyone step out of the princess's way?"", 'Why did the cook tell the princess to come back in half an-hour?', 'Why did the cook say the princess could go upstairs for a little bit?', ""Why did the king think the princess was a king's daughter?""]","['Where was the great feast being held?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to while the king was dancing?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to while the feast was being held?', 'Where did the youngest Princess go to?']","['When was the great feast being held?', 'When did the princess go up to the feast?', 'When did the cook have to return?', 'When did the princess go to the feast?']","['Which princess did the cook ask to go upstairs and look on?', 'Which princess washed off the soot from her face and hands?', ""Which princess did everyone think was a King's daughter?"", ""Which princess did everyone think was a king's daughter?""]"
"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made  her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the  Many-furred Creature. When she came into the kitchen and was setting  about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her,  'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; I  want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; but be sure that you  do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in  future!' So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the  soup for the King. She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could,  and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room,  and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up.","['What did the cook order the Many-furred Creature to do?', 'What did the Many-furred Creature do when she came into the kitchen?', 'What did the cook want the Many-furred Creature to do?', 'What did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to do?']","['How did the Many-furred Creature prepare the soup for the King?', 'How did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to not let a hair fall into the soup?', 'How did the Many-furred creature prepare the soup for the King?', 'How did the Many-furred creature prepare the soup?']","['Who told the Many-furred Creature to make the soup for the King?', 'Who did the cook ask the Many-furred Creature to make the soup for?', 'Who did the cook ask the Many-furred creature to make the soup for?', 'Who did the Many-furred creature turn into?']","['Why did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to not let a hair fall into the soup?', 'Why did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to make the soup for him?', 'Why did the cook tell the Many-furred creature to make the soup for him?', 'Why did the cook want the Many-furred creature to make the soup for him?']","['Where did the Many-furred Creature go after she turned into a human?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature put her gold ring?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature go after she came into the kitchen?', 'Where did the Many-furred creature go after she came into the kitchen?']","['When did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to make the soup for her?', 'When did the Many-furred Creature turn back into a human?', 'When did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to make the soup?', 'When did the cook tell the Many-furred creature to make the soup?']","['Which creature did the cook ask the youngest Princess to turn into?', 'Which one of the Princesses did the youngest Princess turn into?', 'Which creature cooked the soup for the King?', 'Which creature cooked the soup for the king?']"
"When the dance was ended, the King had his soup brought to him and ate it, and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life. But when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there, and he could not imagine how it got in. Then he commanded the cook to be brought before him. The cook was terrified when he heard the command, and said to the Many-furred Creature, 'You must have let a hair fall into the soup, and if you have you deserve a good beating!' When he came before the King, the King asked who had cooked the soup. The cook answered, 'I cooked it.' But the King said, 'That's not true, for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked.' Then the cook said, 'I must confess; I did not cook the soup; the Many-furred Creature did.' 'Let her be brought before me,' said the King.","['What did the King see when he came to the bottom of the dish?', 'What did the cook say when the king asked who cooked the soup?', 'What did the cook do when the king commanded her to bring the soup?', 'What happened after the dance was ended?']","['How did the cook feel when the King commanded him to bring the soup to him?', 'How did the cook feel when the king commanded him to bring the soup to him?', 'How did the cook feel when the king commanded him to be brought before him?', 'How did the king feel when he ate the soup?']","['Who did the King believe cooked the soup?', 'Who did the King say cooked the soup?', 'Who did the King command to bring before him?', 'Who did the cook confess to?']","['Why was the cook terrified when the king commanded him to bring the soup to him?', 'Why did the King think he had never tasted such soup in his life?', 'Why did the cook confess that the Many-furred Creature cooked the soup?', 'Why did the cook say the Many-furred Creature cooked the soup?']","['Where did the King find the gold ring?', 'Where did the King eat the soup?', 'Where did the cook say the soup came from?', 'Where was the gold ring coming from?']","['When did the King eat the soup?', 'When the King came to the bottom of the dish?', 'When did the king eat the soup?', 'When did the King eat his soup?']","['Which creature cooked the soup?', 'Which one of the many furs cooked the soup?', 'Which cook did not cook the soup?', 'Which creature did the cook confess to?']"
"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she  was. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,  'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots  thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he  asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King  could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.    After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature  begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He  answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King  the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little  room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver  as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a  King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her  again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.","['What did the Many-furred Creature beg the cook to do at the second feast?', 'What did the Many-furred Creature do after she washed herself quickly?', 'What did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to do in half an-hour?', 'What did the Many-furred Creature do after she put the dress on?']","['How did the King feel when he saw the Many-furred Creature again?', 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she saw the King again?', 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she saw the king again?', 'How did the Many-furred creature feel when she saw the King again?']","['Who did the Many-furred Creature turn out to be?', 'Who did the cook tell to come back in half an-hour?', 'Who did the Many-furred Creature ask about the ring?', 'Who did the Many-furred creature turn out to be?']","['Why did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to come back in half an hour?', 'Why did the King send the Many-furred Creature away?', 'Why did the Many-furred Creature beg the cook at the last feast?', 'Why was the King delighted to see the Many-furred Creature?']","['Where did the Many-furred Creature go after the cook asked her how she got the ring?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature go to after she washed herself?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature go after she begged the cook to let her go?', 'Where did the Many-furred creature go after she washed herself?']","['When did the Many-furred Creature have to come back?', 'When did the Many-furred Creature come to the king?', 'When did the Many-furred Creature have to return?', 'When did the cook tell the Many-furred Creature to come back?']","['Which dress did the Many-furred Creature put on?', 'Which feast did the Many-furred Creature go to?', 'Which cook told the Many-furred Creature to come back in half an-hour?', 'Which king did the Many-furred Creature meet at the last feast?']"
"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.  When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it.","['What did the cook do when she fetched the golden spinning-wheel?', 'What did the cook always put in the soup?', 'What did the Many-furred Creature do after the dance ended?', 'What happened when the King had a feast for the third time?']","['How did the king feel when the Many-furred Creature disappeared?', 'How did the cook know that the Many-furred Creature cooked the soup?', 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she came before the King?', 'How did the cook turn into the Many-furred Creature?']","['Who prepared the bread-soup?', 'Who did the cook think put something in the soup?', 'Who prepared the soup?', 'Who cooked the soup?']","['Why did the cook think the Many-furred Creature must be a witch?', 'Why did the King let the Many-furred Creature go up for the third time?', 'Why did the cook always put something in the soup?', 'Why did the cook put the golden spinning-wheel in the soup?']","['Where did the Many-furred Creature change back to?', 'Where did the cook put the golden spinning-wheel?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature change into?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature go after the dance ended?']","['When did the cook put the golden spinning-wheel in the soup?', 'When did the cook turn into the Many-furred Creature?', 'When did the Many-furred Creature come before the King?', 'When was the third time the king had a feast?']","['Which one of the four creatures always put something in the soup?', 'Which one of the four creatures cooked the soup?', 'Which one of the three creatures cooked the soup?', 'Which creature cooked the bread-soup?']"
"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white.","['What did the maiden do because she had stayed too long?', 'What did the King command?', 'What did the maiden do when she broke from the King?', ""What did the King put on the maiden's finger?""]","['How did the maiden feel when she broke from the King?', 'How did the maiden feel when she broke from the king?', 'How did the maiden feel when she ran away?', 'How did the maiden turn herself quite black with the soot?']","[""Who put a gold ring on the maiden's finger without her seeing it?"", 'Who did the maiden leave with when the dance was over?', 'Who did the king command to last longer than usual?', 'Who did the king dance with again?']","[""Why did the maiden spring from the King's sight?"", 'Why did the maiden not stop to take off the beautiful dress?', 'Why did the maiden break from the King?', 'Why did the King command that the dance should last longer than usual?']","['Where did the maiden run to?', 'Where did the maiden go after she left the castle?', 'Where did the maiden hide?', 'Where did the maiden go after she ran away?']","['When did the maiden break from the King?', 'When did the maiden run away?', 'When did the dance last longer than usual?', 'When did the maiden slip the gold ring on her finger?']","['Which finger remained white?', ""Which one of the maiden's fingers remained white?"", 'Which maiden did not stop to take off her dress?', 'Which king commanded that the dance should last longer than usual?']"
"The Many-furred Creature now ran into the kitchen, cooked the  King's bread-soup, and when the cook had gone, she laid the gold reel  in the dish. When the King found the reel at the bottom, he had the  Many-furred Creature brought to him, and then he saw the white finger,  and the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance. Then he took her  hand and held her tightly, and as she was trying to get away, she undid  the fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out. The King seized  the cloak and tore it off her. Her golden hair came down, and she stood  there in her full splendour, and could not hide herself away any more.  And when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked  more beautiful than anyone in the world. But the King said, 'You are  my dear bride, and we will never be separated from one another.' So the  wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.","['What did the King find at the bottom of the dish?', ""What did the cook do when she cooked the King's bread-soup?"", 'What did the Many-furred Creature do when the cook had gone?', 'What did the Many-furred Creature do when she was trying to get away?']","[""How did the King feel when he saw the Many-furred Creature's hand?"", 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she was able to get away?', ""How did the king feel when he saw the Many-furred Creature's hand?"", 'How did the Many-furred Creature feel when she undid the fur-cloak?']","[""Who cooked the King's bread-soup?"", 'Who did the King find at the bottom of the dish?', 'Who did the Many-furred Creature marry?', 'Who did the Many-furred Creature turn into after she was washed away?']","[""Why couldn't the Queen of Fairies hide herself away any more?"", 'Why did the Queen of Fairies try to get away?', ""Why didn't the Queen of Fairies want to get married to the King?"", 'Why did the King tear the cloak off the Queen of Fairies?']","['Where did the Many-furred Creature cook the bread-soup?', 'Where did the Many-furred Creature put the gold reel?', 'Where did the Many-furred creature cook the bread-soup?', 'Where did the king find the reel at?']","[""When the Many-furred Creature cooked the King's bread-soup?"", 'When the Queen was trying to get away, she undid the fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out?', 'When did the Queen look beautiful?', 'When the king found the reel at the bottom?']","[""Which one of the many-furred creatures cooked the King's bread-soup?"", ""Which one of the many creatures cooked the King's bread-soup?"", 'Which one of the princesses did the King put on his hand?', 'Which princess did the King marry?']"
