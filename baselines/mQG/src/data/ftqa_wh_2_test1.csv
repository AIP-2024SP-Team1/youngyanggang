Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry. The laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed.  Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted.  ""Welcome, Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" cried the company, perceiving their visitor. The word ""Welcome"" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle.

Dublin!""  It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen's Green.  The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed. He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form.  The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before.  They were approaching home. Jamie heard ""Rathmullan,"" ""Milford,"" ""Tamney,"" and then he knew they were near his own house.  ""You've all had your turn at carrying the young lady,"" said he. ""Why wouldn't I get her for a wee piece?""  ""Ay, Jamie,"" replied they pleasantly, ""you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure.""  Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door.  ""Jamie Freel! Jamie Freel! is that the way you treat us?"" cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door.  Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; then again a sack of wool.  But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, ""Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll mak' her deaf and dumb,"" and she threw something over the young girl.",causal relationship,,Why was a stick left on the bed?,implicit,so it looked like the young lady was still there,so that it appeared that the young lady did not leave,,,,,,,Why

How can a lady eat we'er (our) poor diet and live in we'er poor way? I ax you that, you foolitch fellow!""  ""Well, mother, sure it's better for her to be over here nor yonder,"" and he pointed in the direction of the castle.  Meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire.  ""Poor crathur, she's quare and handsome! Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,"" said the old woman, gazing at their guest with pity and admiration. ""We maun dress her first. What in the name o' fortune have I fit for the likes of her to wear?""  She went to her press in ""the room"" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget.

She was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her.  The poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a ""creepie"" in the chimney corner and buried her face in her hands.  ""What'll we do to keep up a lady like you?"" cried the old woman.  ""I'll work for you both, mother,"" replied the son.  ""An' how could a lady live on we'er poor diet?"" she repeated.  ""I'll work for her,"" was all Jamie's answer.  He kept his word. The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening, while the old woman span by the fire and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment acquired by him in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest.  But she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her. By degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks.  So a year passed and Halloween came round again.

""Sure they'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year.""  Jamie made light of her fears and went his way.  As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us.""  ""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does na' know that three drops out o' this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again.""  Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! Welcome, welcome, Jamie!""  As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out o' this glass in my hand.""  Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire.  ""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother.  ""No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!"" and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field.

She took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her.  The parents could not make enough of Jamie. They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude.  But an awkward complication arose. The daughter would not let him go without her. ""If Jamie goes, I'll go, too,"" she said. ""He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since. If it had not been for him, dear father and mother, you would never have seen me again. If he goes, I'll go, too.""  This being her resolution, the old gentleman said that Jamie should become his son-in-law. The mother was brought from Fannet in a coach-and-four, and there was a splendid wedding.

In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand.  But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them.

The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. 'You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more,' she moaned bitterly. But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, 'Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever.'

Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. 'If you can do this,' she said as she bade him farewell, 'your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore, and will carry you back to me.'  Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess. Three days and three nights they swam through the sea, and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home.

He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. After all, everything was changed. Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. Quickly he saw his old home; yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them.  Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. And he was right. In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by.  Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old. But when the man spoke, he knew he was not dreaming, though he felt as if he had lost his senses.",causal relationship,,Why did Uraschimataro's old house have a strange look?,implicit,His parent did not live in the old house anymore.,A lot of time had passed.,He was not home for years.,explicit,Three hundred years had passed by.,,,,Why

And when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked  more beautiful than anyone in the world.

But she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall not have to marry someone I do not care for.' The King, however, was not to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she determined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping, she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made her face and hands black with soot.
