once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market . since they were very sweet and fragrant , he hoped to get a good price for them . a bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one . the farmer repulsed him , but the bonze did not go . then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names . the bonze said : " you have pears by the hundred in your cart . i only ask for one . surely that does you no great injury . why suddenly grow so angry about it ? "
the bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go . but the farmer would not and did not . an artisan saw the whole affair from his shop , and since the noise annoyed him , he took some money , bought a pear and gave it to the bonze . the bonze thanked him and said : " one like myself , who has given up the world , must not be miserly . i have beautiful pears myself , and i invite you all to eat them with me . " then some one asked : " if you have pears then why do you not eat your own ? " he answered : " i first must have a seed to plant . "
and with that he began to eat the pear with gusto . when he had finished , he held the pit in his hand , took his pick - ax from his shoulder ; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep . into this he thrust the pit , and covered it with earth . then he asked the folk in the market place for water , with which to water it . a pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street , and with it the bonze watered the pit . thousands of eyes were turned on the spot . and the pit could already be seen to sprout . the sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree . branches and leaves burgeoned out from it . it began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened : large , fragrant pears , which hung in thick clusters from the boughs . the bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders . in a moment all the pears had been eaten up . then the bonze took his pick - ax and cut down the tree . crash , crash ! so it went for a while , and the tree was felled . then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait .
when the bonze had begun to make his magic , the farmer , too , had mingled with the crowd . with neck outstretched and staring eyes he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears . when the bonze had gone off he turned around to look after his cart . his pears had all disappeared . then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own . he looked more closely , and the axle of his cart had disappeared . it was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently . the farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could . and when he turned the corner , there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall . and then he realized that the pear - tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle . the bonze , however , was nowhere to be found . and the whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter .
