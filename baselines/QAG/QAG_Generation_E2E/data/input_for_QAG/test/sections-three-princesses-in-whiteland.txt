once upon a time there was a fisherman , who lived near the king 's castle , and caught fish for the king 's table . one day when he had gone fishing , he could not catch a thing . try as he might , no matter how he baited or flung , not the tiniest fish would bite ; but when this had gone on for a while , a head rose from the water and said : " if you will give me the first new thing that has come into your house , you shall catch fish a - plenty ! " then the man agreed quickly , for he could think of no new thing that might have come into the house . so he caught fish all day long , and as many as he could wish for , as may well be imagined .
but when he got home , he found that heaven had sent him a little son , the first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise . and when he told his wife about it , she began to weep and wail , and pray to god because of the vow her husband had made . and the woman 's grief was reported at the castle , and when it came to the king 's ears , and he learned the reason , he promised to take the boy and see if he could not save him . and so the king took him and brought him up as though he were his own son , until he was grown . then one day the boy asked whether he might not go out fishing with his father , he wanted to so very much , said he . the king would not hear of it ; but at last he was given permission , so he went to his father , and everything went well all day long , until they came home in the evening .
then the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief , and went down to the boat to get it . but no sooner was he in the boat than it moved off with a rush , and no matter how hard the youth worked against it with the oars , it was all in vain . the boat drove on and on , all night long , and at last he came to a white strand , far , far away . he stepped ashore , and after he had gone a while he met an old man with a great , white beard . " what is this country called ? " asked the youth . " whiteland , " was the man 's answer , and he asked the youth where he came from , and what he wanted , and the latter told him . " if you keep right on along the shore , " said the man , " you will come to three princesses , buried in the earth so that only their heads show . then the first will call you -- and she is the oldest -- and beg you very hard to come to her and help her ; and the next will do the same ; but you must go to neither of them ; walk quickly past them , and act as though you neither saw nor heard them . but go up to the third , and do what she asks of you , for then you will make your fortune . "
when the youth came to the first princess , she called out to him , and begged him most earnestly to come to her ; but he went on as though he had not seen her . and he passed the next one in the same manner ; but went over to the third . " if you will do what i tell you to , you shall have whichever one of us you want , " said she . yes , he would do what she wanted . so she told him that three trolls had wished them into the earth where they were ; but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle he saw on the edge of the forest .
" now you must go to the castle , and let the trolls whip you one night through for each one of us , " said she , " and if you can hold out , you will have delivered us . " " yes , " said the youth , he could manage that . " when you go in , " added the princess , " you will find two lions standing by the door ; but if you pass directly between them , they will do you no harm . go on into a dark little room and lie down , and then the troll will come and beat you ; but after that you must take the bottle that hangs on the wall , and anoint yourself where he has beaten you , and you will be whole again . and take the sword that hangs beside the bottle , and kill the troll with it . " he did as the princess had told him , passed between the lions as though he did not see them , and right into the little room , where he lay down . the first night a troll with three heads and three whips came , and beat the youth badly ; but he held out , and when the troll had finished , he took the bottle and anointed himself , grasped the sword and killed the troll . when he came out in the morning the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists . the next night it was the same ; but the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips , and beat him worse than the first one .
but when he came out in the morning , the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles . the third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips , and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted . then the troll took him and flung him against the wall , and as he did so the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth , and he was at once sound and whole again . then he did not delay , but grasped the sword , killed the troll , and when he came out in the morning , the princesses were entirely out of the ground . so he chose the youngest of them to be his queen , and lived long with her in peace and happiness . but at last he was minded to travel home , and see how his parents fared . this did not suit his queen ; but since he wanted to go so badly , and finally was on the point of departure , she said to him : " one thing you must promise me , that you will only do what your father tells you to do , but not what your mother tells you to do . " and this he promised . then she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it . so he wished himself home , and his parents could not get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become .
when he had been home a few days , his mother wanted him to go up to the castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be . his father said : " no , he had better not do that , for we will have to do without him in the meantime . " but there was no help for it , the mother begged and pleaded until he went . when he got there he was more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the other king . this did not suit the latter , and he said : " you can see what my queen looks like , but i can not see yours ; and i do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine . " " god grant she were standing here , then you would see soon enough ! " said the young king , and there she stood that very minute . but she was very sad , and said to him : " why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father ? now i must go straight home , and you have used up both of your wishes . " with that she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair , and wished herself home .
then the young king grew very sad , and went about day in , day out , with no other thought than getting back to his queen . " i must try and see whether i can not find out where whiteland is , " thought he , and wandered forth into the wide world . after he had gone a while he came to a hill ; and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the forest -- for they came when he blew his horn -- and him the king asked where whiteland was . " that i do not know , " said he , " but i will ask my beasts . " then he called them up with his horn , and asked whether any of them knew where whiteland might be ; but none of them knew anything about it . then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes . " if you stand in them , " said he , " you will come to my brother , who lives a hundred miles further on . he is the lord of the birds of the air . ask him . when you have found him , turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way , and they will come back home of their own accord . " when the king got there , he turned the snowshoes around , as the lord of the beasts had told him , and they ran home again . he asked about whiteland , and the man called up all the birds with his horn , and asked whether any of them knew where whiteland might be . but none of them knew . long after the rest an old eagle came along ; and he had been out for some ten years , but did not know either .
" well , " said the man , " i will lend you a pair of snowshoes . when you stand in them you will come to my brother , who lives a hundred miles further on . he is the lord of all the fishes in the sea . ask him . but do not forget to turn the snowshoes around again . " the king thanked him , stepped into the snowshoes , and when he came to the one who was lord of all the fishes in the sea , he turned them around , and they ran back like the others . there he once more asked about whiteland . the man called up his fishes with his horn , but none of them knew anything about it . at last there came an old , old carp , whom he had called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble . when he asked him , he said : " yes , i know it well , for i was cook there for fully ten years . to - morrow i have to go back again , because our queen , whose king has not come home again , is going to marry some one else . " " if such be the case , " said the man , " i 'll give you a bit of advice . out there by the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years , fighting with each other about a hat , a cloak and a pair of boots . any one who has these three things can make himself invisible , and wish himself away as far as ever he will . you might say that you would test their possessions , and then decide their quarrel for them . "
then the king thanked him , and did as he said . " why do you stand there fighting till the end of time ? " said he to the brothers . " let me test your possessions if i am to decide your quarrel . " that suited them ; but when he had hat , cloak and boots , he told them : " i will give you my decision the next time we meet ! " and with that he wished himself far away . while he was flying through the air he happened to meet the north wind . " and where are you going ? " asked the north wind . " to whiteland , " said the king , and then he told him what had happened to him . " well , " said the north wind , " you are traveling a little quicker than i am ; for i must sweep and blow out every corner . but when you come to your journey 's end , stand on the steps beside the door , and then i 'll tt . and when the prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all means , i 'll just take him along with me . "
the king did as the north wind told him . he stationed himself on the steps ; and when the north wind came roaring and rushing up , and laid hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook , the prince came out to see what it was all about . but that very moment the king seized him by the collar , and threw him out , and the north wind took him and carried him off . when he had borne him away , the king went into the castle . at first the queen did not recognize him , for he had grown thin and pale because he had wandered so long in his great distress ; but when he showed her the ring , she grew glad at heart , and then they had a wedding which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide .
