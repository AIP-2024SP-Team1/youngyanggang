" some tell about their sweethearts , how they tirled them to the winnock , but i 'll tell you a bonnie tale about a guid oatmeal bannock . "
there was once an old man and his wife , who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn . they were a very canty and contented couple , for they had enough to live on , and enough to do . indeed , they considered themselves quite rich , for , besides their cottage and their garden , they possessed two sleek cows , five hens and a cock , an old cat , and two kittens . the old man spent his time looking after the cows , and the hens , and the garden ; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning . one day , just after breakfast , the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening , so she took down her bakeboard , and put on her girdle , and baked a couple of fine cakes , and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden .
while they were toasting , her husband came in from the byre , and sat down to take a rest in his great arm - chair . presently his eyes fell on the bannocks , and , as they looked very good , he broke one through the middle and began to eat it . when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate , so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her , holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did , and escaped over the hill behind the house . it ran , and it ran , and it ran , until it came to a large newly thatched cottage , and , as the door was open , it took refuge inside , and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire , which was burning in the first room that it came to .
now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . " hoot , " she said , " what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . "
so she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards , and the tailor jumped up with his great shears , and one apprentice grasped the line measure , while another took up the saucer full of pins ; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock . but it dodged them round and round the fire , and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road , with one of the apprentices after it , who tried to snip it in two with his shears . it ran too quickly for him , however , and at last he stopped and went back to the house , while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside . it trundled in at the door , and there was a weaver sitting at his loom , with his wife beside him , winding a clue of yarn .
" what 's that , tibby ? " said the weaver , with a start as the little cake flew past him . " oh ! " cried she in delight , jumping to her feet , " it is a wee bannock . i wonder where it came from ? " " dinna bother your head about that , tibby , " said her man , " but grip it , my woman , grip it . "
but it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock . it was in vain that the goodwife threw her clue at it , and that the goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle . it dodged , and turned , and twisted , like a thing bewitched , till at last it flew out at the door again , and vanished down the hill , " for all the world , " as the old woman said , " like a new tarred sheep , or a daft cow . " in the next house that it came to it found the goodwife in the kitchen , kirning . she had just filled her kirn , and there was still some cream standing in the bottom of her cream jar . " come away , little bannock , " she cried when she saw it . " thou art come in just the nick of time , for i am beginning to feel hungry , and i 'll have cakes and cream for my dinner . "
but the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn , and the goodwife after it . and she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn ; and by the time that she had put it right again , the wee bannock was out at the door and half - way down the brae to the mill . the miller was sifting meal in the trough , but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake . " it 's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them , " he said ; " but i like bannocks and cheese , so just come in , and i will give thee a night 's lodging . "
but the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller , so it turned and ran out of the mill , and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it . after this it ran on , and on , and on , till it came to the smithy , and it popped in there to see what it could see . the smith was busy at the anvil making horse - shoe nails , but he looked up as the wee bannock entered .
" if there be one thing i am fond of , it is a glass of ale and a well - toasted cake , " he cried . " so come inside here , and welcome to you . " but as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale , it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could , and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it . and when he saw that he could not catch it , he flung his heavy hammer at it , in the hope of knocking it down , but , luckily for the little cake , he missed his aim . after this the bannock came to a farmhouse , with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it . in it went , and ran to the fireside . in this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor , and was cloving it with an iron rod , while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven .
" oh , janet , " cried the goodman in surprise , " here comes in a little bannock . it looks rare and good to eat . i 'll have one half of it . " " and i 'll have the other half , " cried the goodwife . " hit it over the back with your cloving - stick , sandy , and knock it down . quick , or it will be out at the door again . " but the bannock played " jook - about , " and dodged behind a chair . " hoot ! " cried janet contemptuously , for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it , and she threw her heckle at it . but the heckle missed it , just as her husband 's cloving - rod had done , for it played " jook - about " again , and flew out of the house .
this time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather . here the goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire , and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow . " oh , jock ! come here , come here , " cried the goodwife . " you are crying for a little bannock for your supper ; come here , histie , quick , and help me to catch it . " " ay , ay , " assented jock , jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room . " but where is it ? i can not see it . " " there , man , there , " cried his wife , " under that chair . run thou to that side ; i will keep to this . "
so jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair ; but , in his hurry , he tripped and fell , and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door . through the whins and up the hillside it ran , and over the top of the hill , to a shepherd 's cottage on the other side . the inmates were just sitting down to their porridge , and the goodwife was scraping the pan . " save us and help us , " she exclaimed , stopping with the spoon half - way to her mouth . " there 's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside . " " sneck the door , " cried the husband , " and we 'll try to catch it . it would come in handy after the porridge . "
but the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit . it turned and ran as fast as it could , and the shepherd and his wife and all the bairns ran after it , with their spoons in their hands , in hopes of catching it . and when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could , he threw his bonnet at it , and almost struck it ; but it escaped all these dangers , and soon it came to another house , where the folk were just going to bed . the goodman was half undressed , and the goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire .
" what 's that ? " said he , " for the bowl of brose that i had at supper - time was n't very big . " " catch it , then , " answered his wife , " and i 'll have a bit , too . quick ! quick ! throw your coat over it or it will be away . " so the goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock , and almost managed to smother it ; but it struggled bravely , and got out , breathless and hot , from under it . then it ran out into the grey light again , for night was beginning to fall , and the goodman ran out after it , without his coat . he chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field , and in amongst a fine patch of whins . then he lost it ; and , as he was feeling cold without his coat , he went home .
as for the poor little bannock , it thought that it would creep under a whin bush and lie there till morning , but it was so dark that it never saw that there was a fox 's hole there . so it fell down the fox 's hole , and the fox was very glad to see it , for he had had no food for two days . " oh , welcome , welcome , " he cried ; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth , and that was the end of the poor wee bannock . and if a moral be wanted for this tale , here it is : that people should never be too uplifted or too cast down over anything , for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock , and , lo and behold ! the fox got it after all .
