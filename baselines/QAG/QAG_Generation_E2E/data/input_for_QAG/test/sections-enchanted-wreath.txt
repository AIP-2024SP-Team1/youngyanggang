once upon a time there lived near a forest a man and his wife and two girls ; one girl was the daughter of the man , and the other the daughter of his wife ; and the man 's daughter was good and beautiful , but the woman 's daughter was cross and ugly . however , her mother did not know that , but thought her the most bewitching maiden that ever was seen .
one day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood . they worked hard all day , but in spite of the chopping they were very cold , for it rained heavily , and when they returned home , they were wet through . then , to his vexation , the man found that he had left his axe behind him , and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless . so he said to his wife : ' i have dropped my axe in the forest , bid your daughter go and fetch it , for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary . '
but the wife answered : ' if your daughter is wet already , it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe . besides , she is a great strong girl , and a little rain will not hurt her , while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold . ' by long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more , and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe .
the walk took some time , for it was very dark , and her shoes often stuck in the mud , but she was brave as well as beautiful and never thought of turning back merely because the path was both difficult and unpleasant . at last , with her dress torn by brambles that she could not see , and her fact scratched by the twigs on the trees , she reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting in the morning , and found the axe in the place he had left it . to her surprise , three little doves were sitting on the handle , all of them looking very sad .
' you poor little things , ' said the girl , stroking them . ' why do you sit there and get wet ? go and fly home to your nest , it will be much warmer than this ; but first eat this bread , which i saved from my dinner , and perhaps you will feel happier . it is my father 's axe you are sitting on , and i must take it back as fast as i can , or i shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother . ' she then crumbled the bread on the ground , and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it . ' good - bye , ' she said , picking up the axe , and went her way homewards . by the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better , and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree .
' that is a good girl , ' said one ; ' i really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came . i should like to do something to show how grateful i am . ' ' well , let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it , ' cried another . ' and let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers , ' rejoined the third . ' yes , that will do beautifully , ' said the first . and when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head , and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen . the father , who was sitting by the fire , thought that , in spite of her muddy clothes , he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely ; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy .
' how absurd to walk about on such a pouring night , dressed up like that , ' she remarked crossly , and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke , to place it on her own daughter . as she did so the roses became withered and brown , and the birds flew out of the window . ' see what a trumpery thing it is ! ' cried the stepmother ; ' and now take your supper and go to bed , for it is near upon midnight . ' but though she pretended to despise the wreath , she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it . now it happened that the next evening the father , who had been alone in the forest , came back a second time without his axe . the stepmother 's heart was glad when she saw this , and she said quite mildly : ' why , you have forgotten your axe again , you careless man ! but now your daughter shall stay at home , and mine shall go and bring it back ' ; and throwing a cloak over the girl 's shoulders , she bade her hasten to the forest .
with a very ill grace the damsel set forth , grumbling to herself as she went ; for though she wished for the wreath , she did not at all want the trouble of getting it . by the time she reached the spot where her stepfather had been cutting the wood the girl was in a very bad temper indeed , and when she caught sight of the axe , there were the three little doves , with drooping heads and soiled , bedraggled feathers , sitting on the handle . ' you dirty creatures , ' cried she , ' get away at once , or i will throw stones at you ! ' and the doves spread their wings in a fright and flew up to the very top of a tree , their bodies shaking with anger . ' what shall we do to revenge ourselves on her ? ' asked the smallest of the doves , ' we were never treated like that before . ' ' never , ' said the biggest dove . ' we must find some way of paying her back in her own coin ! ' ' i know , ' answered the middle dove ; ' she shall never be able to say anything but " dirty creatures " to the end of her life . ' ' oh , how clever of you ! that will do beautifully , ' exclaimed the other two . and they flapped their wings and clucked so loud with delight , and made such a noise , that they woke up all the birds in the trees close by .
' what in the world is the matter ? ' asked the birds sleepily . ' that is our secret , ' said the doves . meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever ; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures . ' well , did you get the wreath ? ' cried she . ' dirty creatures ! ' answered her daughter . ' do n't speak to me like that ! what do you mean ? ' asked the mother again . ' dirty creatures ! ' repeated the daughter , and nothing else could she say . then the woman saw that something evil had befallen her , and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter .
' you are at the bottom of this , i know , ' she cried ; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing . if the poor girl 's life had been miserable before , it was ten times worse now , for the moment her father 's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night ; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath , which the doves had placed again on her head .
things went on like this for some weeks , when , one day , as the king 's son was riding through the forest , he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before . he tied his horse to a tree , and followed where the sound led him , and , to his surprise , he saw before him a beautiful girl chopping wood , with a wreath of pink rose - buds , out of which the singing came . standing in the shelter of a tree , he watched her a long while , and then , hat in hand , he went up and spoke to her . ' fair maiden , who are you , and who gave you that wreath of singing roses ? ' asked he , for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely you never saw them .
' i live in a hut on the edge of the forest , ' she answered , blushing , for she had never spoken to a prince before . ' as to the wreath , i know not how it came there , unless it may be the gift of some doves whom i fed when they were starving ! ' the prince was delighted with this answer , which showed the goodness of the girl 's heart , and besides he had fallen in love with her beauty , and would not be content till she promised to return with him to the palace , and become his bride . the old king was naturally disappointed at his son 's choice of a wife , as he wished him to marry a neighbouring princess ; but as from his birth the prince had always done exactly as he like , nothing was said and a splendid wedding feast was got ready .
the day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger , bearing handsome presents to her father , and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her . as may be imagined , the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill , and had to take to their beds , and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again ; but that did not happen . at length , however , they began to feel better , for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm .
her plan was this . in the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch , who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew . to this witch she would go and beg her to make her a mask with the face of her stepdaughter , and when she had the mask the rest would be easy . she told her daughter what she meant to do , and although the daughter could only say ' dirty creatures , ' in answer , she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased .
everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped . by the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk , and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her , that very few people could have told the difference . however , she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it - for that , of course , was what she intended her to do - she had better pretend that she had a toothache , and cover her head with a lace veil . the woman thanked her and paid her well , and returned to her hut , carrying the mask under her cloak .
in a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned , and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning , so that his wife would be alone all day . this was a chance not to be missed , and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace , where she had never been before . the princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one , and she welcomed them both gladly , and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them . at last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her ; and here , the woman seizing her opportunity , stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing , into the deep water , where she instantly sank to the bottom . then she fastened the mask on her daughter , flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak , which the princess had let fall , and finally arranged a lace veil over her head .
' rest your cheek on your hand , as if you were in pain , when the prince returns , ' said the mother ; ' and be careful not to speak , whatever you do . i will go back to the witch and see if she can not take off the spell laid on you by those horrible birds . ah ! why did i not think of it before ! ' no sooner had the prince entered the palace than he hastened to the princess 's apartments , where he found her lying on the sofa apparently in great pain . ' my dearest wife , what is the matter with you ? ' he cried , kneeling down beside her , and trying to take her hand ; but she snatched it away , and pointing to her cheek murmured something he could not catch . ' what is it ? tell me ! is the pain bad ? when did it begin ? shall i send for your ladies to bath the place ? ' asked the prince , pouring out these and a dozen other questions , to which the girl only shook her head . ' but i ca n't leave you like this , ' he continued , starting up , ' i must summon all the court physicians to apply soothing balsams to the sore place ! ' and as he spoke he sprang to his feet to go in search of them once came near her the trick would at once be discovered , that she forgot her mother 's counsel not to speak , and forgot even the spell that had been laid upon her , and catching hold of the prince 's tunic , she cried in tones of entreaty : ' dirty creatures ! '
the young man stopped , not able to believe his ears , but supposed that pain had made the princess cross , as it sometimes does . however , he guessed somehow that she wised to be left alone , so he only said : ' well , i dare say a little sleep will do you good , if you can manage to get it , and that you will wake up better to - morrow . ' now , that night happened to be very hot and airless , and the prince , after vainly trying to rest , at length got up and went to the window . suddenly he beheld in the moonlight a form with a wreath of roses on her head rise out of the sea below him and step on to the sands , holding out her arms as she did so towards the palace . ' that maiden is strangely like my wife , ' thought he ; ' i must see her closer ! and he hastened down to the water . but when he got there , the princess , for she indeed it was , had disappeared completely , and he began to wonder if his eyes had deceived him . '
the next morning he went to the false bride 's room , but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up , though she ate everything they set before her . the prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her , for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment , and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her , and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself . at length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians ; he did not tell her what he was going to do , lest it should make her worse , but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king 's person to follow him to the princess 's apartments . unfortunately , as they entered , the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves , and shrieked out : ' dirty creatures ! dirty creatures ! ' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once , and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain . he then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness , but not a word would she say .
late that evening , when he had performed all the tiresome duties which fall to the lot of every prince , the young man was leaning out of his window , refreshing himself with the cool breezes that blew off the sea . his thoughts went back to the scene of the morning , and he wondered if , after all , he had not made a great mistake in marrying a low - born wife , however beautiful she might be . how could he have imagined that the quiet , gentle girl who had been so charming a companion to him during the first days of their marriage , could have become in a day the rude , sulky woman , who could not control her temper even to benefit herself . one thing was clear , if she did not change her conduct very shortly he would have to send her away from court . he was thinking these thoughts , when his eyes fell on the sea beneath him , and there , as before , was the figure that so closely resembled his wife , standing with her feet in the water , holding out her arms to him .
' wait for me ! wait for me ! wait for me ! ' he cried ; not even knowing he was speaking . but when he reached the shore there was nothing to be seen but the shadows cast by the moonlight . a state ceremonial in a city some distance off caused the prince to ride away at daybreak , and he left without seeing his wife again . ' perhaps she may have come to her senses by to - morrow , ' said he to himself ; ' and , anyhow , if i am going to send her back to her father , it might be better if we did not meet in the meantime ! then he put the matter from his mind , and kept his thoughts on the duty that lay before him . '
it was nearly midnight before he returned to the palace , but , instead of entering , he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock . he had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea , and stretched out her arms towards his window . in an instant the prince had seized her hand , and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water - for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her - he held her fast . ' you are my own wife , and i shall never let you go , ' he said . but the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw . then the hare changed into a fish , and the fish into a bird , and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake . this time the prince 's hand nearly opened of itself , but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut , and drawing his sword cut off its head , when the spell was broken , and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first , the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy .
the very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter 's tongue , which would break the dove 's spell , if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea ; if not , then it would be useless . the mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink , and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again ; but , to make all quite safe , the old woman might bewitch the girl ; and so she did . after that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible , and made her way straight into her daughter 's room .
' i have got it ! i have got it ! ' she cried triumphantly , and laid the ointment on her daughter 's tongue . ' now what do you say ? ' she asked proudly . ' dirty creatures ! dirty creatures ! ' answered the daughter ; and the mother wrung her hands and wept , as she knew that all her plans had failed . at this moment the prince entered with his real wife . ' you both deserved death , ' he said , ' and if it were left to me , you should have it . but the princess has begged me to spare your lives , so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island , where you will stay till you die . ' then the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it , and it sailed away , and no more was heard of them . but the prince and his wife lived together long and happily , and ruled their people well .
