at the time when the tang dynasty reigned over the middle kingdom , there were master swordsmen of various kinds . those who came first were the saints of the sword . they were able to take different shapes at will , and their swords were like strokes of lightning . before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen . yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind , and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world . the second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes . it was their custom to slay the unjust , and to come to the aid of the oppressed . they wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt . by magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water . they could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls , and they came and went and left no trace . the swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers . they hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies . and death was an everyday matter to them .
old dragonbeard must have been a master swordsman standing midway between those of the first and of the second order . molo , however , of whom this story tells , was a sword hero . at that time there lived a young man named tsui , whose father was a high official and the friend of the prince . and the father once sent his son to visit his princely friend , who was ill . the son was young , handsome and gifted . he went to carry out his father 's instructions . when he entered the prince 's palace , there stood three beautiful slave girls , who piled rosy peaches into a golden bowl , poured sugar over them and presented them to him . after he had eaten he took his leave , and his princely host ordered one of the slave girls , rose - red by name , to escort him to the gate . as they went along the young man kept looking back at her . and she smiled at him and made signs with her fingers . first she would stretch out three fingers , then she would turn her hand around three times , and finally she would point to a little mirror which she wore on her breast . when they parted she whispered to him : " do not forget me ! "
when the young man reached home his thoughts were all in confusion . and he sat down absent - mindedly like a wooden rooster . now it happened that he had an old servant named molo , who was an extraordinary being . " what is the trouble , master , " said he . " why are you so sad ? do you not want to tell your old slave about it ? " so the boy told him what had occurred , and also mentioned the signs the girl had made to him in secret .
said molo : " when she stretched out three fingers , it meant that she is quartered in the third court of the palace . when she turned round her hand three times , it meant the sum of three times five fingers , which is fifteen . when she pointed at the little mirror , she meant to say that on the fifteenth , when the moon is round as a mirror , at midnight , you are to go for her . " then the young man was roused from his confused thoughts , and was so happy he could hardly control himself . but soon he grew sad again and said : " the prince 's palace is shut off as though by an ocean . how would it be possible to win into it ? "
" nothing easier , " said molo . " on the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them , and thus i will carry you there . yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl 's court , who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god . no one can pass by him , so he must be killed . " when the appointed day had come , the servant said : " there is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself ! " full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine , and the old man took a chain - hammer and disappeared with it .
and after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said : " the dog is dead , and there is nothing further to hinder us ! " at midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk , and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace . they reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar . then they saw the glow of a little lamp , and heard rose - red sigh deeply . the entire court was silent and deserted . the youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room . long and searchingly rose - red looked at him , then seized his hand . " i knew that you were intelligent , and would understand my sign language . but what magic power have you at your disposal , that you were able to get here ? "
the youth told her in detail how molo had helped him . " and where is molo ? " she asked . " outside , before the curtain , " was his answer .
then she called him in and gave him wine to drink from a jade goblet and said : " i am of good family and have come here from far away . force alone has made me a slave in this palace . i long to leave it . for though i have jasper chop - sticks with which to eat , and drink my wine from golden flagons , though silk and satin rustle around me and jewels of every kind are at my disposal , all these are but so many chains and fetters to hold me here . dear molo , you are endowed with magic powers . i beg you to save me in my distress ! if you do , i will be glad to serve your master as a slave , and will never forget the favor you do me . "
the youth looked at molo . molo was quite willing . first he asked permission to carry away rose - red 's gear and jewels in sacks and bags . three times he went away and returned until he had finished . then he took his master and rose - red upon his back , and flew away with them over the steep walls . none of the watchmen of the prince 's palace noticed anything out of the way . at home the youth hid rose - red in a distant room . when the prince discovered that one of his slave - girls was missing , and that one of his wild dogs had been killed , he said : " that must have been some powerful sword hero ! " and he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned , and that investigations should be made in secret .
two years passed , and the youth no longer thought of any danger . hence , when the flowers began to bloom in the spring , rose - red went driving in a small wagon outside the city , near the river . and there one of the prince 's servants saw her , and informed his master . the latter sent for the youth , who , since he could not conceal the matter , told him the whole story exactly as it had happened . said the prince : " the whole blame rests on rose - red . i do not reproach you . yet since she is now your wife i will let the whole matter rest . but molo will have to suffer for it ! "
so he ordered a hundred armored soldiers , with bows and swords , to surround the house of the youth , and under all circumstances to take molo captive . but molo drew his dagger and flew up the high wall . thence he looked about him like a hawk . the arrows flew as thick as rain , but not one hit him . and in a moment he had disappeared , no one knew where . yet ten years later one of his former master 's servants ran across him in the south , where he was selling medicine . and he looked exactly as he had looked ten years before .
