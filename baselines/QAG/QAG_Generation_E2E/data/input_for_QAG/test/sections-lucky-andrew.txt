there was once a rich peasant who had two sons , named john nicholas and lucky andrew . the oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail . he was a most unpleasant customer to deal with , and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the northland are , as a rule , though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities . the other , lucky andrew , was wild and high spirited , but always good natured , and no matter how badly off he might be , he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star . when the eagle , in order to defend his nest , belabored his head and face till the blood ran , he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star , if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet . did his boat capsize , which occasionally happened , and did they discover him hanging to it , quite overcome with the water , cold and exertion , and asked him how he felt , he would reply : " o , quite well . i have been saved . i surely am in luck ! "
when their father died , both of them were of age , and not long after they both had to go out to the sand - banks to fetch some fishing - nets , which had been left there since the summer fishing . it was late in the fall , after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer fishing . andrew had his gun along , which he carried with him wherever he went . john nicholas did not say much while they were underway ; but he thought all the harder . they were not ready to set out for home again until near evening .
" hark , lucky andrew , do you know there will be a storm to - night ? " said john nicholas , and looked out across the sea . " i think it would be best if we stayed here until morning ! " " there 'll be no storm , " said andrew . " the seven sisters have not put on their fog - caps , so you may be quite at rest . "
but his brother complained of being weary , and at length they decided to remain there for the night . when andrew awoke he found himself alone ; and he saw neither brother nor boat , until he came to the highest point of the island . then he discovered him far out , darting for land like a sea - gull . andrew did not understand the whole affair . there were still provisions there , as well as a dish of curd , his gun and various other things . so andrew wasted but little time in thought . " he will come back this evening , " said he . " only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat . " but in the evening there was no brother to be seen , and andrew waited day by day , and week by week ; until at last , he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself , and not have to divide it . and such was the case , for when john nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip , he had capsized the boat , and declared that lucky andrew had been drowned .
but the latter did not lose heart . he gathered drift - wood along the strand , shot sea - birds , and looked for mussels and roots . he built himself a raft of drift - timber , and fished with a pole that had also been left behind . one day , while he was at work , he happened to notice a depression or hollow in the sand , as though made by the keel of a large northland schooner , and he could plainly trace the braidings of the hawsers from the strand up to the top of the island . then he thought to himself that he was in no danger , for he saw there was truth in the report he had often heard , that the meer - folk made the island their abode , and did much business with their ships .
" god be praised for good company ! that was just what i needed . yes , it is true , as i have always said , that i was born under a lucky star , " thought andrew to himself ; perhaps he said so too , for occasionally he really had to talk a little . so he lived through the fall . once he saw a boat , and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it ; but that very moment the sail dropped , and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top speed , for they thought the meer - trolls were making signs and waving .
on christmas eve andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea ; and when he came out , he saw a glow of light that came from a great northland schooner , which was gliding toward the land -- yet such a ship he had never yet seen . it has a main - sail of uncommon size , which looked to him to be of silk , and the most delicate tackling , as thin as though woven of steel wire , and everything else was in proportion , as fine and handsome as any northlander might wish to have . the whole schooner was filled with little people dressed in blue , but the girl who stood at the helm was adorned like a bride , and looked as splendid as a queen , for she wore a crown and costly garments . yet any one could see that she was a human being , for she was tall , and handsomer than the meer - folk . in fact , lucky andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had seen . the schooner headed for the land where andrew stood ; but with his usual presence of mind , he hurried to the fisherman 's hut , pulled down his gun from the wall , and crept up into the large loft and hid himself , so that he could see all that passed in the hut . he soon noticed that the whole room was alive with people .
they filled it completely and more , and still more of them came in . then the walls began to crack , and the little hut spread out at all corners , and grew so splendid and magnificent that the wealthiest merchant could not have had its equal ; it was almost like being in a royal castle . tables were covered with the most exquisite silver and gold . when they had eaten they began to dance . under cover of the noise , andrew crept to the look - out at the side of the roof , and climbed down . then he ran to the schooner , threw his flint - stone over it , and in order to make certain , cut a cross into it with his sharp - cutting knife . when he came back again , the dance was in full swing . the tables were dancing and the benches and chairs -- everything else in the room was dancing , too . the only one who did not dance was the bride ; she only sat there and looked on , and when the bridegroom came to fetch her , she sent him away . for the moment there was no thought of stopping .
the fiddler knew neither rest nor repose , and did not pass his cap , but played merrily on with his left hand , and beat time with his foot , until he was dripping with sweat , and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke . when andrew noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing , he thought to himself : " now i had better shoot away , or else he will play me right off the ground ! " so he turned his gun , thrust it through the window , and shot it off over the bride 's head ; but upside down , otherwise the bullet would have hit him . the moment the shot crashed , all the troll - folk tumbled out of the door together ; but when they saw that the schooner was banned on the shore , they wailed and crept into a hole in the hill . but all the gold and silver dishes were left behind , and the bride , too , was still sitting there . she told lucky andrew that she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child . once , when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking , she had taken her along ; but when she had to go home for a moment , she left the child sitting under a juniper - bush , and told her that she might eat the berries if she only repeated three times : " i eat juniper - berries blue , wherein jesu 's cross i view . i eat whortle - berries red , since ' twas for my sake he bled ! "
but after her mother had gone , she found so many berries that she forgot to say her verse , and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill . and there no harm had been done her , save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand , and the goblins had been kind to her ; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be , she felt as though something weighed upon her , and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband . when andrew learned who her mother and her people were , he saw that they were related to him , and they became very good friends . so andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star . then they sailed home , and took along the schooner , and all the gold and silver , and all the treasure which had been left in the hut , and then andrew was far wealthier than his brother .
but the latter , who suspected where all this wealth had come from , did not wish to be any poorer than andrew . he knew that trolls and goblins walk mainly on christmas eve , and for that reason he sailed out to the sand banks at that time . and on christmas eve he did see a light or fire , but it seemed to be like will - o'-the - wisps fluttering about . when he came nearer he heard splashes , horrible howls , and cold , piercing cries , and there was a smell of slime and sea - weed , as at ebb - tide . terrified , he ran up into the hut , from whence he could see the trolls on the shore . they were short and thick like hay - ricks , completely covered with fur , with kirtles of skins , fishing boots , and enormous fist - gloves . in place of head and hair they had bundles of sea - weed . when they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like that of rotting wood , and when they shook themselves they showered sparks about them . when they drew nearer , john nicholas crawled up into the loft as his brother had done . the goblins dragged a great stone into the hut , and began to beat their gloves dry against it , and meanwhile they screamed so that john nicholas 's blood turned to ice in his hiding - place . then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth in order to make the fire burn again ; while the others carried in heather - grass and drift - wood , as coarse and heavy as lead .
the smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft , and in order to catch his breath and get some fresh air , he tried to crawl out of the look - out in the roof ; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother , stuck fast and could move neither in nor out . then he grew frightened and began to scream ; but the goblins screamed much louder , and roared and howled , and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut . but when the cock crowed they disappeared , and john nicholas freed himself , too . yet when he returned home from his trip , he had lost his reason , and after that the same cold , sinister screams which are the mark of the troll in the northland , might often be heard sounding from store - rooms and lofts where he happened to be . before his death , however , his reason returned , and he was buried in consecrated ground , as they say . but after that time no human foot ever trod the sand - banks again . they sank , and the meer - folk , it is believed , went to the lekang islands . andrew 's luck held good ; no ship made more successful trips than his own ; but whenever he came to the lekang islands he lay becalmed -- the goblins went aboard or ashore with their goods -- but after a time he had fair winds , whether he happened to want to go to bergen , or sail home . he had many children , and all of them were bright and vigorous , yet every one of them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand .
