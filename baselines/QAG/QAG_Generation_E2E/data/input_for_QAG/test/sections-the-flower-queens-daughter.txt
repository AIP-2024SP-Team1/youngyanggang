a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him , when he came to a deep open ditch . he was turning aside to avoid it , when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch . he dismounted from his horse , and stepped along in the direction the sound came from . to his astonishment he found an old woman , who begged him to help her out of the ditch . the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave , asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there . ' my son , ' answered the old woman , ' i am a very poor woman , and soon after midnight i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning ; but i lost my way in the dark , and fell into this deep ditch , where i might have remained for ever but for your kindness . '
then the prince said to her , ' you can hardly walk ; i will put you on my horse and lead you home . where do you live ? ' ' over there , at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance , ' replied the old woman . the prince lifted her on to his horse , and soon they reached the hut , where the old woman got down , and turning to the prince said , ' just wait a moment , and i will give you something . ' and she disappeared into her hut , but returned very soon and said , ' you are a mighty prince , but at the same time you have a kind heart , which deserves to be rewarded . would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife ? ' ' most certainly i would , ' replied the prince .
so the old woman continued , ' the most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the queen of the flowers , who has been captured by a dragon . if you wish to marry her , you must first set her free , and this i will help you to do . i will give you this little bell : if you ring it once , the king of the eagles will appear ; if you ring it twice , the king of the foxes will come to you ; and if you ring it three times , you will see the king of the fishes by your side . these will help you if you are in any difficulty . now farewell , and heaven prosper your undertaking . ' she handed him the little bell , and there disappeared hut and all , as though the earth had swallowed her up .
when it dawned on the prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy , and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket , he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the flower queen free , and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid . so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home . he had roamed round the world for a whole year , and his horse had died of exhaustion , while he himself had suffered much from want and misery , but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of . at last one day he came to a hut , in front of which sat a very old man . the prince asked him , ' do you not know where the dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the flower queen prisoner ? '
' no , i do not , ' answered the old man . ' but if you go straight along this road for a year , you will reach a hut where my father lives , and possibly he may be able to tell you . ' the prince thanked him for his information , and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road , and at the end of it came to the little hut , where he found a very old man . he asked him the same question , and the old man answered , ' no , i do not know where the dragon lives . but go straight along this road for another year , and you will come to a hut in which my father lives . i know he can tell you . '
and so the prince wandered on for another year , always on the same road , and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man . he put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson ; but this time the old man answered , ' the dragon lives up there on the mountain , and he has just begun his year of sleep . for one whole year he is always awake , and the next he sleeps . but if you wish to see the flower queen 's daughter go up the second mountain : the dragon 's old mother lives there , and she has a ball every night , to which the flower queen 's daughter goes regularly . ' so the prince went up the second mountain , where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows . he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard , and was just going to walk in , when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted ?
the prince replied , ' i have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the dragon 's mother , and would like to enter her service . ' this flattering speech pleased the dragons , and the eldest of them said , ' well , you may come with me , and i will take you to the mother dragon . ' they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls , all made of gold and diamonds . in the twelfth room they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne . she was the ugliest woman under the sun , and , added to it all , she had three heads . her appearance was a great shock to the prince , and so was her voice , which was like the croaking of many ravens . she asked him , ' why have you come here ? '
the prince answered at once , ' i have heard so much of your beauty and kindness , that i would very much like to enter your service . ' ' very well , ' said the mother dragon ; ' but if you wish to enter my service , you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days ; but if you do n't bring her home safely every evening , we will eat you up . ' the prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow .
but no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished . the prince sought for her in vain , and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate . as he sat thus lost in thought , he noticed an eagle flying over his head . then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell , and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once . in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him , and the king of the eagles sank at his feet .
' i know what you want of me , ' the bird said . ' you are looking for the mother dragon 's mare who is galloping about among the clouds . i will summon all the eagles of the air together , and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you . ' and with these words the king of the eagles flew away . towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air , and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them . they sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him . then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon , who was full of wonder when she saw him , and said , ' you have succeeded to - day in looking after my mare , and as a reward you shall come to my ball to - night . ' she gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper , and led him to a big room where several young he - dragons and she - dragons were dancing together . here , too , was the flower queen 's beautiful daughter . her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world , and her complexion was like lilies and roses . as the prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear , ' i have come to set you free ! '
then the beautiful girl said to him , ' if you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day , ask the mother dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward . ' the ball came to an end at midnight , and early next morning the prince again led the mother dragon 's mare out into the meadow . but again she vanished before his eyes . then he took out his little bell and rang it twice . in a moment the king of the foxes stood before him and said : ' i know already what you want , and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill . '
with these words the king of the foxes disappeared , and in the evening many thousand foxes brought the mare to the prince . then he rode home to the mother - dragon , from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver , and again she led him to the ball - room . the flower queen 's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound , and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear : ' if you succeed again to - morrow , wait for me with the foal in the meadow . after the ball we will fly away together . '
on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again ; but once more she vanished before his eyes . then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times . in a moment the king of the fishes appeared , and said to him : ' i know quite well what you want me to do , and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together , and tell them to bring you back the mare , who is hiding herself in a river . '
towards evening the mare was returned to him , and when he led her home to the mother dragon she said to him : ' you are a brave youth , and i will make you my body - servant . but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with ? ' the prince begged for a foal of the mare , which the mother dragon at once gave him , and over and above , a cloak made of gold , for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty .
so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak ; but before the entertainment was over he slipped away , and went straight to the stables , where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the flower queen 's daughter . towards midnight the beautiful girl appeared , and placing her in front of him on his horse , the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen 's dwelling . but the dragons had noticed their flight , and woke their brother out of his year 's sleep . he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened , and determined to lay siege to the flower queen 's palace ; but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling , through which no one could force a way .
when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince , she said to him : ' i will give my consent to your marriage gladly , but my daughter can only stay with you in summer . in winter , when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow , she must come and live with me in my palace underground . ' the prince consented to this , and led his beautiful bride home , where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence . the young couple lived happily together till winter came , when the flower queen 's daughter departed and went home to her mother . in summer she returned to her husband , and their life of joy and happiness began again , and lasted till the approach of winter , when the flower queen 's daughter went back again to her mother . this coming and going continued all her life long , and in spite of it they always lived happily together .
