many , many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis - ball growing out of his right cheek . this lump was a great disfigurement to the old man , and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it . he tried everything he could think of . he consulted many doctors far and near , and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally . but it was all of no use . the lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his face , and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it , and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life .
one day the firewood gave out in his kitchen , so , as his wife wanted some at once , the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home . it was a fine day in the early autumn , and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home . so the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood , and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife . when the day began to draw to a close , he turned his face homewards .
the old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily . he looked about for some shelter , but there was not even a charcoal - burner 's hut near . at last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree . the hole was near the ground , so he crept in easily , and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain shower , and that the weather would soon clear .
but much to the old man 's disappointment , instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily , and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain . the thunder roared so terrifically , and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning , that the old man could hardly believe himself to be alive . he thought that he must die of fright . at last , however , the sky cleared , and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun . the old man 's spirits revived when he looked out at the beautiful twilight , and he was about to step out from his strange hiding - place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people caught his ear . he at once thought that his friends had come to look for him , and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home .
but on looking out from the tree , what was his amazement to see , not his friends , but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot . the more he looked , the greater was his astonishment . some of these demons were as large as giants , others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies , others again had absurdly long noses , and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear . all had horns growing on their foreheads . the old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree . fortunately for him the demons did not see him , as the tree was in the background . so he picked himself up and crept back into the tree .
while he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home , he heard the sounds of gay music , and then some of the demons began to sing . " what are these creatures doing ? " said the old man to himself . " i will look out , it sounds very amusing . "
on peeping out , the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his back against the tree in which he had taken refuge , and all the other demons were sitting round , some drinking and some dancing . food and wine was spread before them on the ground , and the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely .
it made the old man laugh to see their strange antics . " how amusing this is ! " laughed the old man to himself " i am now quite old , but i have never seen anything so strange in all my life . " he was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were doing , that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on .
the demon chief was just taking a big cup of sake and watching one of the demons dancing . in a little while he said with a bored air : " your dance is rather monotonous . i am tired of watching it . is n't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow ? "
now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life , and was quite an expert in the art , and he knew that he could do much better than the demon . " shall i go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do ? it may be dangerous , for if i do n't please them they may kill me ! " said the old fellow to himself .
his fears , however , were soon overcome by his love of dancing . in a few minutes he could restrain himself no longer , and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once . the old man , realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these strange creatures or not , exerted his skill and wit to the utmost .
the demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly taking part in their entertainment , and then their surprise soon gave place to admiration . " how strange ! " exclaimed the horned chief . " i never saw such a skillful dancer before ! he dances admirably ! "
when the old man had finished his dance , the big demon said : " thank you very much for your amusing dance . now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us , " and with these words he handed him his largest wine - cup .
the old man thanked him very humbly : " i did not expect such kindness from your lordship . i fear i have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing . " " no , no , " answered the big demon . " you must come often and dance for us . your skill has given us much pleasure . " the old man thanked him again and promised to do so . " then will you come again to - morrow , old man ? " asked the demon . " certainly , i will , " answered the old man . " then you must leave some pledge of your word with us , " said the demon . " whatever you like , " said the old man . " now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge ? " asked the demon , looking round .
then said one of the demon 's attendants kneeling behind the chief : " the token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in his possession . i see the old man has a wen on his right cheek . now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate . let my lord take the lump from the old man 's right cheek , and he will surely come to - morrow , if only to get that back . "
" you are very clever , " said the demon chief , giving his horns an approving nod . then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw - like hand , and took the great lump from the old man 's right cheek . strange to say , it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon 's touch , and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished .
the old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened . he hardly knew for some time where he was . when he came to understand what had happened to him , he was delighted to find that the lump on his face , which had for so many years disfigured him , had really been taken away without any pain to himself . he put up his hand to feel if any scar remained , but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left .
the sun had long set , and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky . the old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home . he patted his right cheek all the time , as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen . he was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly -- he ran and danced the whole way home .
he found his wife very anxious , wondering what had happened to make him so late . he soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon . she was quite as happy as her husband when he showed her that the ugly lump had disappeared from his face , for in her youth she had prided herself on his good looks , and it had been a daily grief to her to see the horrid growth .
now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man . he , too , had for many years been troubled with the growth of a wen on his left cheek , and he , too , had tried all manner of things to get rid of it , but in vain .
he heard at once , through the servant , of his neighbor 's good luck in losing the lump on his face , so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it . the good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him . he described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide , and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset .
the old neighbor started out the very next afternoon , and after hunting about for some time , came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described . here he hid himself and waited for the twilight .
just as he had been told , the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song . when this had gone on for some time the chief of the demons looked around and said : " it is now time for the old man to come as he promised us . why does n't he come ? "
when the second old man heard these words he ran out of his hiding - place in the tree and , kneeling down before the oni , said : " i have been waiting for a long time for you to speak ! " " ah , you are the old man of yesterday , " said the demon chief . " thank you for coming , you must dance for us soon . "
the old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance . but he had never learned to dance , and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different positions . he thought that anything would please the demons , so he just hopped about , waving his arms and stamping his feet , imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen .
the oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition , and said amongst themselves : " how badly he dances to - day ! " then to the old man the demon chief said : " your performance to - day is quite different from the dance of yesterday . we do n't wish to see any more of such dancing . we will give you back the pledge you left with us . you must go away at once . "
with these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day before , and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before him . the lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if it had grown there always , and all attempts to pull it off were useless . the wicked old man , instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped , found to his dismay that he had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first .
he put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare . no , sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left . the demons had all disappeared , and there was nothing for him to do but to return home . he was a pitiful sight , for his face , with the two large lumps , one on each side , looked just like a japanese gourd .
