a young man was out walking one day in erin , leading a stout cart - horse by the bridle . he was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his father , who was a fisherman , had been drowned at sea , and wondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them . suddenly a hand was laid on his shoulder , and a voice said to him : ' will you sell me your horse , son of the fisherman ? ' and looking up he beheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand , a falcon on his shoulder , and a dog by his side . ' what will you give me for my horse ? ' asked the youth . ' will you give me your gun , and your dog , and your falcon ? '
' i will give them , ' answered the man , and he took the horse , and the youth took the gun and the dog and the falcon , and went home with them . but when his mother heard what he had done she was very angry , and beat him with a stick which she had in her hand . ' that will teach you to sell my property , ' said she , when her arm was quite tired , but ian her son answered her nothing , and went off to his bed , for he was very sore . that night he rose softly , and left the house carrying the gun with him . ' i will not stay here to be beaten , ' thought he , and he walked and he walked and he walked , till it was day again , and he was hungry and looked about him to see if he could get anything to eat . not very far off was a farm - house , so he went there , and knocked at the door , and the farmer and his wife begged him to come in , and share their breakfast .
' ah , you have a gun , ' said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner . ' that is well , for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn , and i can not catch it . it is fortune that has sent you to me . ' ' i will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you , ' replied the youth , and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield ; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the trigger , when , behold ! instead of a deer , a woman with long black hair was standing there . at this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in surprise , but as he looked , there was the deer eating the corn again . and thrice this happened , till the deer ran away over the moor , and the young man after her .
on they went , on and on and one , till they reached a cottage which was thatched with heather . with a bound the deer sprang on the roof , and lay down where none could see her , but as she did so she called out , ' go in , fisher 's son , and eat and drink while you may . ' so he entered and found food and wine on the table , but no man , for the house belonged to some robbers , who were still away at their wicked business . after ian , the fisher 's son , had eaten all he wanted , he hid himself behind a great cask , and very soon he heard a noise , as of men coming through the heather , and the small twigs snapping under their feet . from his dark corner he could see into the room , and he counted four and twenty of them , all big , cross - looking men . ' some one has been eating our dinner , ' cried they , ' and there was hardly enough for ourselves . '
' it is the man who is lying under the cask , ' answered the leader . ' go and kill him , and then come and eat your food and sleep , for we must be off betimes in the morning . ' so four of them killed the fisher 's son and left him , and then went to bed . by sunrise they were all out of the house , for they had far to go . and when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof , to where the dead man lay , and she shook her head over him , and wax fell from her ear , and he jumped up as well as ever .
' trust me and eat as you did before , and no harm shall happen to you , ' said she . so ian ate and drank , and fell sound asleep under the cask . in the evening the robbers arrived very tired , and crosser than they had been yesterday , for their luck had turned and they had brought back scarcely anything . ' someone has eaten our dinner again , ' cried they . ' it is the man under the barrel , ' answered the captain . ' let four of you go and kill him , but first slay the other four who pretended to kill him last night and did n't because he is still alive . '
then ian was killed a second time , and after the rest of the robbers had eaten , they lay down and slept till morning . no sooner were their faces touched with the sun 's rays than they were up and off . then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the dead man , and he was as well as ever . by this time he did not mind what befell him , so sure was he that the deer would take care of him , and in the evening that which had happened before happened again -- the four robbers were put to death and the fisher 's son also , but because there was no food left for them to eat , they were nearly mad with rage , and began to quarrel . from quarrelling they went on to fighting , and fought so hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor . then the deer entered , and the fisher 's son was restored to life , and bidding him follow her , she ran on to a little white cottage where dwelt an old woman and her son , who was thin and dark .
' here i must leave you , ' said the deer , ' but to - morrow meet me at midday in the church that is yonder . ' and jumping across the stream , she vanished into a wood . next day he set out for the church , but the old woman of the cottage had gone before him , and had stuck an enchanted stick called ' the spike of hurt ' in a crack of the door , so that he would brush against it as he stepped across the threshold . suddenly he felt so sleepy that he could not stand up , and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deep slumber , not knowing that the dark lad was watching him . nothing could waken him , not even the sound of sweetest music , nor the touch of a lady who bent over him . a sad look came on her face , as she saw it was no use , and at last she gave it up , and lifting his arm , wrote her name across the side--'the daughter of the king of the town under the waves . ' ' i will come to - morrow , ' she whispered , though he could not hear her , and she went sorrowfully away .
then he awoke , and the dark lad told him what had befallen him , and he was very grieved . but the dark lad did not tell him of the name that was written underneath his arm . on the following morning the fisher 's son again went to the church , determined that he would not go to sleep , whatever happened . but in his hurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt , and sank down where he stood , wrapped in slumber . a second time the air was filled with music , and the lady came in , stepping softly , but though she laid his head on her knee , and combed his hair with a golden comb , his eyes opened not . then she burst into tears , and placing a beautifully wrought box in his pocket she went her way . the next day the same thing befell the fisher 's son , and this time the lady wept more bitterly than before , for she said it was the last chance , and she would never be allowed to come any more , for home she must go .
as soon as the lady had departed the fisher 's son awoke , and the dark lad told him of her visit , and how he would never see her as long as he lived . at this the fisher 's son felt the cold creeping up to his heart , yet he knew the fault had not been his that sleep had overtaken him . ' i will search the whole world through till i find her , ' cried he , and the dark lad laughed as he heard him . but the fisher 's son took no heed , and off he went , following the sun day after day , till his shoes were in holes and his feet were sore from the journey . nought did he see but the birds that made their nests in the trees , not so much as a goat or a rabbit . on and on and on he went , till suddenly he came upon a little house , with a woman standing outside it .
' all hail , fisher 's son ! ' said she . ' i know what you are seeking ; enter in and rest and eat , and to - morrow i will give you what help i can , and send you on your way . ' gladly did ian the fisher 's son accept her offer , and all that day he rested , and the woman gave him ointment to put on his feet , which healed his sores . at daybreak he got up , ready to be gone , and the woman bade him farewell , saying : ' i have a sister who dwells on the road which you must travel . it is a long road , and it would take you a year and a day to reach it , but put on these old brown shoes with holes all over them , and you will be there before you know it . then shake them off , and turn their toes to the known , and their heels to the unknown , and they will come home of themselves . '
the fisher 's son did as the woman told him , and everything happened just as she had said . but at parting the second sister said to him , as she gave him another pair of shoes : ' go to my third sister , for she has a son who is keeper of the birds of the air , and sends them to sleep when night comes . he is very wise , and perhaps he can help you . ' then the young man thanked her , and went to the third sister .
the third sister was very kind , but had no counsel to give him , so he ate and drank and waited till her son came home , after he had sent all the birds to sleep . he thought a long while after his mother had told him the young man 's story , and at last he said that he was hungry , and the cow must be killed , as he wanted some supper . so the cow was killed and the meat cooked , and a bag made of its red skin . ' now get into the bag , ' bade the son , and the young man got in and took his gun with him , but the dog and the falcon he left outside . the keeper of the birds drew the string at the top of the bag , and left it to finish his supper , when in flew an eagle through the open door , and picked the bag up in her claws and carried it through the air to an island . there was nothing to eat on the island , and the fisher 's son thought he would die of food , when he remembered the box that the lady had put in his pocket . he opened the lid , and three tiny little birds flew out , and flapping their wings they asked , ' good master , is there anything we can do for thee ? '
' bear me to the kingdom of the king under the waves , ' he answered , and one little bird flew on to his head , and the others perched on each of his shoulders , and he shut his eyes , and in a moment there he was in the country under the sea . then the birds flew away , and the young man looked about him , his heart beating fast at the thought that here dwelt the lady whom he had sought all the world over . he walked on through the streets , and presently he reached the house of a weaver who was standing at his door , resting from his work . ' you are a stranger here , that is plain , ' said the weaver , ' but come in , and i will give you food and drink . ' and the young man was glad , for he knew not where to go , and they sat and talked till it grew late .
' stay with me , i pray , for i love company and am lonely , ' observed the weaver at last , and he pointed to a bed in a corner , where the fisher 's son threw himself , and slept till dawn . ' there is to be a horse - race in the town to - day , ' remarked the weaver , ' and the winner is to have the king 's daughter to wife . ' the young man trembled with excitement at the news , and his voice shook as he answered : ' that will be a prize indeed , i should like to see the race . ' ' oh , that is quite easy -- anyone can go , ' replied the weaver . ' i would take you myself , but i have promised to weave this cloth for the king . '
' that is a pity , ' returned the young man politely , but in his heart he rejoiced , for he wished to be alone . leaving the house , he entered a grove of trees which stood behind , and took the box from his pocket . he raised the lid , and out flew the three little birds . ' good master , what shall we do for thee ? ' asked they , and he answered , ' bring me the finest horse that ever was seen , and the grandest dress , and glass shoes . ' ' they are here , master , ' said the birds , and so they were , and never had the young man seen anything so splendid .
mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race , and took his place among them . many good beasts were there which had won many races , but the horse of the fisher 's son left them all behind , and he was first at the winning post . the king 's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize , for he went back to the wood , and got off his horse , and put on his old clothes , and bade the box place some gold in his pockets . after that he went back to the weaver 's house , and told him that the gold had been given him by the man who had won the race , and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him . now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess , the king ordered another race to be run , and the fisher 's son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before , and easily distanced everybody else . but again he left the prize unclaimed , and so it happened on the third day , when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were gathered to see the race , for they were filled with curiosity to know who the winner could be .
' if he will not come of his own free will , he must be brought , ' said the king , and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sent to seek him in every street of the town . this took many days , and when at last they found the young man in the weaver 's cottage , he was so dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance , that they declared he could not be the winner they had been searching for , but a wicked robber who had murdered ever so many people , but had always managed to escape . ' yes , it must be the robber , ' said the king , when the fisher 's son was led into his presence ; ' build a gallows at once and hang him in the sight of all my subjects , that they may behold him suffer the punishment of his crimes . '
so the gallows was built upon a high platform , and the fisher 's son mounted the steps up to it , and turned at the top to make the speech that was expected from every doomed man , innocent or guilt . as he spoke he happened to raise his arm , and the king 's daughter , who was there at her father 's side , saw the name which she had written under it . with a shriek she sprang from her seat , and the eyes of the spectators were turned towards her . ' stop ! stop ! ' she cried , hardly knowing what she said . ' if that man is hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also . ' and running up to where the fisher 's son was standing , she took him by the hand , saying , ' father , this is no robber or murderer , but the victor in the three races , and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me . '
then , without waiting for a reply , she conducted him into the palace , and he bathed in a marble bath , and all the dirt that the fairies had put upon him disappeared like magic , and when he had dressed himself in the fine garments the princess had sent to him , he looked a match for any king 's daughter in erin . he went down into the great hall where she was awaiting him , and they had much to tell each other but little time to tell it in , for the king her father , and the princes who were visiting him , and all the people of the kingdom were still in their places expecting her return . ' how did you find me out ? ' she whispered as they went down the passage .
' the birds in the box told me , ' answered he , but he could say no more , as they stepped out into the open space that was crowded with people . there the princes stopped . ' o kings ! ' she said , turning towards them , ' if one of you were killed to - day , the rest would fly ; but this man put his trust in me , and had his head cut off three times . because he has done this , i will marry him rather than one of you , who have come hither to we d me , for many kings here sought to free me from the spells , but none could do it save ian the fisher 's son .
