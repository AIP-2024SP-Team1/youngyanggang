far up in a green valley in the island of hoy stands an immense boulder . it is hollow inside , and the natives of these northern islands call it the dwarfie stone , because long centuries ago , so the legend has it , snorro the dwarf lived there . nobody knew where snorro came from , or how long he had dwelt in the dark chamber inside the dwarfie stone . all that they knew about him was that he was a little man , with a queer , twisted , deformed body and a face of marvellous beauty , which never seemed to look any older , but was always smiling and young . men said that this was because snorro 's father had been a fairy , and not a denizen of earth , who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth , but nobody knew whether this were true or not , for the dwarf had inhabited the dwarfie stone long before the oldest man or woman in hoy had been born . one thing was certain , however : he had inherited from his mother , whom all men agreed had been mortal , the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition . and the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did he become , until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel round his neck , into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflection of his handsome face .
and he would not attend to the country people who came to seek his help , unless they bowed themselves humbly before him and spoke to him as if he were a king . i say that the country people sought his help , for he spent his time , or appeared to spend it , in collecting herbs and simples on the hillsides , which he carried home with him to his dark abode , and distilled medicines and potions from them , which he sold to his neighbours at wondrous high prices . he was also the possessor of a wonderful leathern - covered book , clasped with clasps of brass , over which he would pore for hours together , and out of which he would tell the simple islanders their fortunes , if they would . for they feared the book almost as much as they feared snorro himself , for it was whispered that it had once belonged to odin , and they crossed themselves for protection as they named the mighty enchanter .
but all the time they never guessed the real reason why snorro chose to live in the dwarfie stone . i will tell you why he did so . not very far from the stone there was a curious hill , shaped exactly like a wart . it was known as the wart hill of hoy , and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a wonderful carbuncle , which , when it was found , would bestow on its finder marvellous magic gifts -- health , wealth , and happiness . everything , in fact , that a human being could desire . and the curious thing about this carbuncle was , that it was said that it could be seen at certain times , if only the people who were looking for it were at the right spot at the right moment . now snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone , so , while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book or distilling medicines from his herbs , he was really keeping a keen look - out during his wanderings , noting every tuft of grass or piece of rock under which it might be hidden . and at night , when everyone else was asleep , he would creep out , with pickaxe and spade , to turn over the rocks or dig over the turf , in the hope of finding the long - sought - for treasure underneath them .
he was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey - headed raven , who lived in the cave along with him , and who was his bosom friend and companion . the islanders feared this bird of ill omen as much , perhaps , as they feared its master ; for , although they went to consult snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities , and bought medicines and love - potions from him , they always looked upon him with a certain dread , feeling that there was something weird and uncanny about him . now , at the time we are speaking of , orkney was governed by two earls , who were half - brothers . paul , the elder , was a tall , handsome man , with dark hair , and eyes like sloes . all the country people loved him , for he was so skilled in knightly exercises , and had such a sweet and loving nature , that no one could help being fond of him . old people 's eyes would brighten at the sight of him , and the little children would run out to greet him as he rode by their mothers ' doors . and this was the more remarkable because , with all his winning manner , he had such a lack of conversation that men called him paul the silent , or paul the taciturn .
harold , on the other hand , was as different from his brother as night is from day . he was fair - haired and blue - eyed , and he had gained for himself the name of harold the orator , because he was always free of speech and ready with his tongue . but for all this he was not a favourite . for he was haughty , and jealous , and quick - tempered , and the old folks ' eyes did not brighten at the sight of him , and the babes , instead of toddling out to greet him , hid their faces in their mothers ' skirts when they saw him coming . harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brother best , and the knowledge made him jealous of him , so a coldness sprang up between them . now it chanced , one summer , that earl harold went on a visit to the king of scotland , accompanied by his mother , the countess helga , and her sister , the countess fraukirk .
and while he was at court he met a charming young irish lady , the lady morna , who had come from ireland to scotland to attend upon the scottish queen . she was so sweet , and good , and gentle that earl harold 's heart was won , and he made up his mind that she , and only she , should be his bride . but although he had paid her much attention , lady morna had sometimes caught glimpses of his jealous temper ; she had seen an evil expression in his eyes , and had heard him speak sharply to his servants , and she had no wish to marry him . so , to his great amazement , she refused the honour which he offered her , and told him that she would prefer to remain as she was . earl harold ground his teeth in silent rage , but he saw that it was no use pressing his suit at that moment . so what he could not obtain by his own merits he determined to obtain by guile . accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the lady morna to go back with them on a visit , hoping that when she was alone with him in orkney , he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him , and induce her to become his wife . and all the while he never remembered his brother paul ; or , if he did , he never thought it possible that he could be his rival .
but that was just the very thing that happened . the lady morna , thinking no evil , accepted the countess helga 's invitation , and no sooner had the party arrived back in orkney than paul , charmed with the grace and beauty of the fair irish maiden , fell head over ears in love with her . and the lady morna , from the very first hour that she saw him , returned his love . of course this state of things could not long go on hidden , and when harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds . seizing a dagger , he rushed up to the turret where his brother was sitting in his private apartments , and threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the lovely stranger . but paul met him with pleasant words . " calm thyself , brother , " he said . " it is true that i love the lady , but that is no proof that i shall win her . is it likely that she will choose me , whom all men name paul the silent , when she hath the chance of marrying you , whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of harold the orator ? "
at these words harold 's vanity was flattered , and he thought that , after all , his step - brother was right , and that he had a very small chance , with his meagre gift of speech , of being successful in his suit . so he threw down his dagger , and , shaking hands with him , begged him to pardon his unkind thoughts , and went down the winding stair again in high good - humour with himself and all the world . by this time it was coming near to the feast of yule , and at that festival it was the custom for the earl and his court to leave kirkwall for some weeks , and go to the great palace of orphir , nine miles distant . and in order to see that everything was ready , earl paul took his departure some days before the others . the evening before he left he chanced to find the lady morna sitting alone in one of the deep windows of the great hall . she had been weeping , for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure ; and at the sight of her distress the kind - hearted young earl could no longer contain himself , but , folding her in his arms , he whispered to her how much he loved her , and begged her to promise to be his wife .
she agreed willingly . hiding her rosy face on his shoulder , she confessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she had seen him ; and ever since that moment she had determined that , if she could not we d him , she would we d no other man . for a little time they sat together , rejoicing in their new - found happiness . then earl paul sprang to his feet . " let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother , " he said . " harold may be disappointed at first , for i know , sweetheart , he would fain have had thee for his own . but his good heart will soon overcome all that , and he will rejoice with us also . " but the lady morna shook her head . she knew , better than her lover , what earl harold 's feeling would be ; and she would fain put off the evil hour .
" let us hold our peace till after yule , " she pleaded . " it will be a joy to keep our secret to ourselves for a little space ; there will be time enough then to let all the world know . " rather reluctantly , earl paul agreed ; and next day he set off for the palace at orphir , leaving his lady - love behind him . little he guessed the danger he was in ! for , all unknown to him , his step - aunt , countess fraukirk , had chanced to be in the hall , the evening before , hidden behind a curtain , and she had overheard every word that morna and he had spoken , and her heart was filled with black rage . for she was a hard , ambitious woman , and she had always hated the young earl , who was no blood - relation to her , and who stood in the way of his brother , her own nephew ; for , if paul were only dead , harold would be the sole earl of orkney . and now that he had stolen the heart of the lady morna , whom her own nephew loved , her hate and anger knew no bounds . she had hastened off to her sister 's chamber as soon as the lovers had parted ; and there the two women had remained talking together till the chilly dawn broke in the sky .
countess fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every word . ] next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that separates pomona ( on the mainland ) from hoy . in it sat a woman , but who she was , or what she was like , no one could say , for she was covered from head to foot with a black cloak , and her face was hidden behind a thick , dark veil . snorro the dwarf knew her , even before she laid aside her trappings , for countess fraukirk was no stranger to him . in the course of her long life she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil deeds , and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold . he therefore welcomed her gladly ; but when he had heard the nature of her errand his smiling face grew grave again , and he shook his head . " i have served thee well , lady , in the past , " he said , " but methinks that this thing goeth beyond my courage . for to compass an earl 's death is a weighty matter , especially when he is so well beloved as is the earl paul . " " thou knowest why i have taken up my abode in this lonely spot -- how i hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle . thou knowest also how the people fear me , and hate me too , forsooth . and if the young earl died , and suspicion fell on me , i must needs fly the island , for my life would not be worth a grain of sand . then my chance of success would be gone . nay ! i can not do it , lady ; i can not do it . "
but the wily countess offered him much gold , and bribed him higher and higher , first with wealth , then with success , and lastly she promised to obtain for him a high post at the court of the king of scotland ; and at that his ambition stirred within him , his determination gave way , and he consented to do what she asked . " i will summon my magic loom , " he said , " and weave a piece of cloth of finest texture and of marvellous beauty ; and before i weave it i will so poison the thread with a magic potion that , when it is fashioned into a garment , whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes . " " thou art a clever knave , " answered the countess , a cruel smile lighting up her evil face , " and thou shalt be rewarded . let me have a couple of yards of this wonderful web , and i will make a bonnie waistcoat for my fine young earl and give it to him as a yuletide gift . then i reckon that he will not see the year out . " " that will he not , " said dwarf snorro , with a malicious grin ; and the two parted , after arranging that the piece of cloth should be delivered at the palace of orphir on the day before christmas eve .
now , when the countess fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand , strange things were happening at the castle at kirkwall . for harold , encouraged by his brother 's absence , offered his heart and hand once more to the lady morna . once more she refused him , and in order to make sure that the scene should not be repeated , she told him that she had plighted her troth to his brother . when he heard that this was so , rage and fury were like to devour him . mad with anger , he rushed from her presence , flung himself upon his horse , and rode away in the direction of the sea shore . while he was galloping wildly along , his eyes fell on the snow - clad hills of hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the one island from the other . and his thoughts flew at once to snorro the dwarf , who he had had occasion , as well as his step - aunt , to visit in bygone days . " i have it , " he cried . " stupid fool that i was not to think of it at once . i will go to snorro , and buy from him a love - potion , which will make my lady morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindly towards me . "
so he made haste to hire a boat , and soon he was speeding over the tossing waters on his way to the island of hoy . when he arrived there he hurried up the lonely valley to where the dwarfie stone stood , and he had no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant , for snorro was standing at the hole that served as a door , his raven on his shoulder , gazing placidly at the setting sun . a curious smile crossed his face when , hearing the sound of approaching footsteps , he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble . " what bringeth thee here , sir earl ? " he asked gaily , for he scented more gold . " i come for a love - potion , " said harold ; and without more ado he told the whole story to the wizard . " i will pay thee for it , " he added , " if thou wilt give it to me quickly . " snorro looked at him from head to foot . " blind must the maiden be , sir orator , " he said , " who needeth a love - potion to make her fancy so gallant a knight . " earl harold laughed angrily . " it is easier to catch a sunbeam than a woman 's roving fancy , " he replied . " i have no time for jesting . for , hearken , old man , there is a proverb that saith , ' time and tide wait for no man , ' so i need not expect the tide to wait for me . the potion i must have , and that instantly . "
snorro saw that he was in earnest , so without a word he entered his dwelling , and in a few minutes returned with a small phial in his hand , which was full of a rosy liquid . " pour the contents of this into the lady morna 's wine - cup , " he said , " and i warrant thee that before four - and - twenty hours have passed she will love thee better than thou lovest her now . " then he waved his hand , as if to dismiss his visitor , and disappeared into his dwelling - place . earl harold made all speed back to the castle ; but it was not until one or two days had elapsed that he found a chance to pour the love - potion into the lady morna 's wine - cup . but at last , one night at supper , he found an opportunity of doing so , and , waving away the little page - boy , he handed it to her himself .
she raised it to her lips , but she only made a pretence at drinking , for she had seen the hated earl fingering the cup , and she feared some deed of treachery . when he had gone back to his seat she managed to pour the whole of the wine on the floor , and smiled to herself at the look of satisfaction that came over harold 's face as she put down the empty cup . his satisfaction increased , for from that moment she felt so afraid of him that she treated him with great kindness , hoping that by doing so she would keep in his good graces until the court moved to orphir , and her own true love could protect her . harold , on his side , was delighted with her graciousness , for he felt certain that the charm was beginning to work , and that his hopes would soon be fulfilled . a week later the court removed to the royal palace at orphir , where earl paul had everything in readiness for the reception of his guests .
of course he was overjoyed to meet lady morna again , and she was overjoyed to meet him , for she felt that she was now safe from the unwelcome attentions of earl harold . but to earl harold the sight of their joy was as gall and bitterness , and he could scarcely contain himself , although he still trusted in the efficacy of snorro the dwarf 's love - potion . as for countess fraukirk and countess helga , they looked forward eagerly to the time when the magic web would arrive , out of which they hoped to fashion a fatal gift for earl paul . at last , the day before christmas eve , the two wicked women were sitting in the countess helga 's chamber talking of the time when earl harold would rule alone in orkney , when a tap came to the window , and on looking round they saw dwarf snorro 's grey - headed raven perched on the sill , a sealed packet in its beak .
they opened the casement , and with a hoarse croak the creature let the packet drop on to the floor ; then it flapped its great wings and rose slowly into the air again its head turned in the direction of hoy . with fingers that trembled with excitement they broke the seals and undid the packet . it contained a piece of the most beautiful material that anyone could possibly imagine , woven in all the colours of the rainbow , and sparkling with gold and jewels . " twill make a bonnie waistcoat , " exclaimed countess fraukirk , with an unholy laugh . " the silent earl will be a braw man when he gets it on . " then , without more ado , they set to work to cut out and sew the garment . all that night they worked , and all next day , till , late in the afternoon , when they were putting in the last stitches , hurried footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase , and earl harold burst open the door .
his cheeks were red with passion , and his eyes were bright , for he could not but notice that , now that she was safe at orphir under her true love 's protection , the lady morna 's manner had grown cold and distant again , and he was beginning to lose faith in snorro 's charm . angry and disappointed , he had sought his mother 's room to pour out his story of vexation to her . he stopped short , however , when he saw the wonderful waistcoat lying on the table , all gold and silver and shining colours . it was like a fairy garment , and its beauty took his breath away .
" for whom hast thou purchased that ? " he asked , hoping to hear that it was intended for him . " tis a christmas gift for thy brother paul , " answered his mother , and she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was , had he given her time to speak . but her words fanned his fury into madness , for it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything . " everything is for paul ! i am sick of his very name , " he cried . " by my troth , he shall not have this ! " and he snatched the vest from the table . it was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his feet , begging him to lay it down , and warning him that there was not a thread in it which was not poisoned . he paid no heed to their words , but rushed from the room , and , drawing it on , ran downstairs with a reckless laugh , to show the lady morna how fine he was .
alas ! alas ! scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in great pain . everyone crowded round him , and the two countesses , terrified now by what they had done , tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body . but he felt that it was too late , the deadly poison had done its work , and , waving them aside , he turned to his brother , who , in great distress , had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms . " i wronged thee , paul , " he gasped . " for thou hast ever been true and kind . forgive me in thy thoughts , and , " he added , gathering up his strength for one last effort , and pointing to the two wretched women who had wrought all this misery , " _ beware of those two women _ , for they seek to take thy life . " then his head sank back on his brother 's shoulder , and , with one long sigh , he died . when he learned what had happened , and understood where the waistcoat came from , and for what purpose it had been intended , the anger of the silent earl knew no bounds . he swore a great oath that he would be avenged , not only on snorro the dwarf , but also on his wicked step - mother and her cruel sister .
his vengeance was baulked , however , for in the panic and confusion that followed harold 's death , the two countesses slipped out of the palace and fled to the coast , and took boat in haste to scotland , where they had great possessions , and where they were much looked up to , and where no one would believe a word against them . but retribution fell on them in the end , as it always does fall , sooner or later , on everyone who is wicked , or selfish , or cruel ; for the norsemen invaded the land , and their castle was set on fire , and they perished miserably in the flames . when earl paul found that they had escaped , he set out in hot haste for the island of hoy , for he was determined that the dwarf , at least , should not escape . but when he came to the dwarfie stone he found it silent and deserted , all trace of its uncanny occupants having disappeared .
no one knew what had become of them ; a few people were inclined to think that the dwarf and his raven had accompanied the countess fraukirk and the countess helga on their flight , but the greater part of the islanders held to the belief , which i think was the true one , that the powers of the air spirited snorro away , and shut him up in some unknown place as a punishment for his wickedness , and that his raven accompanied him . at any rate , he was never seen again by any living person , and wherever he went , he lost all chance of finding the magic carbuncle . as for the silent earl and his irish sweetheart , they were married as soon as earl harold 's funeral was over ; and for hundreds of years afterwards , when the inhabitants of the orkney isles wanted to express great happiness , they said , " as happy as earl paul and the countess morna . "
