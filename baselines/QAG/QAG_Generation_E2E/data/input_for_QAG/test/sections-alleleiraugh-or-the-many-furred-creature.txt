there was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair , and she was so beautiful that you could n't find anyone like her in the world . it happened that she fell ill , and when she felt that she must soon die , she sent for the king , and said , ' if you want to marry after my death , make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as i am , and has just such golden hair as i have . promise me this . ' after the king had promised her this , she closed her eyes and died . for a long time the king was not to be comforted , and he did not even think of taking a second wife . at last his councillors said , ' the king must marry again , so that we may have a queen . ' so messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late queen in beauty . but there was no one in the wide world , and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair . then the messengers came home again , not having been able to find a queen .
now , the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had just such golden hair . one day when she had grown up , her father looked at her , and saw that she was exactly like her mother , so he said to his councillors , ' i will marry my daughter to one of you , and she shall be queen , for she is exactly like her dead mother , and when i die her husband shall be king . ' but when the princess heard of her father 's decision , she was not at all pleased , and said to him , ' before i do your bidding , i must have three dresses ; one as golden as the sun , one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars .
besides these , i want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin ; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it . ' but she thought to herself , ' this will be quite impossible , and i shall not have to marry someone i do not care for . ' the king , however , was not to be turned from his purpose , and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses , one as golden as the sun , and one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars ; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom , and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur . at last , when all was ready , the king commanded the cloak to be brought to him , and he spread it out before the princess , and said , ' tomorrow shall be your wedding - day . ' when the princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father 's resolution , she determined to flee away . in the night , when everyone else was sleeping , she got up and took three things from her treasures , a gold ring , a little gold spinning - wheel , and a gold reel ; she put the sun , moon , and star dresses in a nut - shell , drew on the cloak of many skins , and made her face and hands black with soot . then she commended herself to god , and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest . and as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep .
the sun rose and she still slept on and on , although it was nearly noon . now , it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it . when his dogs came to the tree , they sniffed , and ran round and round it , barking . the king said to the huntsmen , ' see what sort of a wild beast is in there . ' the huntsmen went in , and then came back and said , ' in the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we do n't know , and we have never seen one like it ; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur ; but it is lying down asleep . ' the king said , ' see if you can catch it alive , and then fasten it to the cart , and we will take it with us . ' when the huntsmen seized the maiden , she awoke and was frightened , and cried out to them , ' i am a poor child , forsaken by father and mother ; take pity on me , and let me go with you . ' then they said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can work in the kitchen ; come with us and sweep the ashes together . ' so they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace . there they showed her a tiny room under the stairs , where no daylight came , and said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can live and sleep here . ' then she was sent into the kitchen , where she carried wood and water , poked the fire , washed vegetables , plucked fowls , swept up the ashes , and did all the dirty work . so the many - furred creature lived for a long time in great poverty . ah , beautiful king 's daughter , what is going to befall you now ?
it happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace , that she said to the cook , ' can i go upstairs for a little bit and look on ? i will stand outside the doors . ' the cook replied , ' yes , you can go up , but in half - an - hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes . ' then she took her little oil - lamp , and went into her little room , drew off her fur cloak , and washed off the soot from her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth , and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud . then she opened the nut , and took out the dress as golden as the sun . and when she had done this , she went up to the feast , and everyone stepped out of her way , for nobody knew her , and they thought she must be a king 's daughter . but the king came towards her and gave her his hand , and danced with her , thinking to himself , ' my eyes have never beheld anyone so fair ! ' when the dance was ended , she curtseyed to him , and when the king looked round she had disappeared , no one knew whither . the guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned , but no one had seen her .
she had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress , made her face and hands black , put on the fur cloak , and was once more the many - furred creature . when she came into the kitchen and was setting about her work of sweeping the ashes together , the cook said to her , ' let that wait till to - morrow , and just cook the king 's soup for me ; i want to have a little peep at the company upstairs ; but be sure that you do not let a hair fall into it , otherwise you will get nothing to eat in future ! ' so the cook went away , and the many - furred creature cooked the soup for the king . she made a bread - soup as well as she possibly could , and when it was done , she fetched her gold ring from her little room , and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up .
when the dance was ended , the king had his soup brought to him and ate it , and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life . but when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there , and he could not imagine how it got in . then he commanded the cook to be brought before him . the cook was terrified when he heard the command , and said to the many - furred creature , ' you must have let a hair fall into the soup , and if you have you deserve a good beating ! ' when he came before the king , the king asked who had cooked the soup . the cook answered , ' i cooked it . ' but the king said , ' that 's not true , for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked . ' then the cook said , ' i must confess ; i did not cook the soup ; the many - furred creature did . ' ' let her be brought before me , ' said the king .
when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head . ' ' how did you get the ring which was in the soup ? ' he asked . ' i know nothing at all about the ring , ' she answered . so the king could find out nothing , and was obliged to send her away . after a time there was another feast , and the many - furred creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on . he answered , ' yes , but come back again in half - an - hour and cook the king the bread - soup that he likes so much . ' so she ran away to her little room , washed herself quickly , took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on . then she went upstairs looking just like a king 's daughter , and the king came towards her , delighted to see her again , and as the dance had just begun , they danced together .
but when the dance was ended , she disappeared again so quickly that the king could not see which way she went . she ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the many - furred creature , and went into the kitchen to cook the bread - soup . when the cook was upstairs , she fetched the golden spinning - wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it . it was brought to the king , who ate it , and liked it as much as the last time . he had the cook sent to him , and again he had to confess that the many - furred creature had cooked the soup . then the many - furred creature came before the king , but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head , and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning - wheel . when the king had a feast for the third time , things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two . the cook said , ' you must be a witch , many - furred creature , for you always put something in the soup , so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the king than any that i cook . ' but because she begged hard , he let her go up for the usual time . now she put on the dress as shining as the stars , and stepped into the hall in it .
the king danced again with the beautiful maiden , and thought she had never looked so beautiful . and while he was dancing , he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it , and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual . when it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his , but she broke from him , and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight . she ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs , but because she had stayed too long beyond the half - hour , she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress , but only threw the fur cloak over it , and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot , one finger remaining white .
the many - furred creature now ran into the kitchen , cooked the king 's bread - soup , and when the cook had gone , she laid the gold reel in the dish . when the king found the reel at the bottom , he had the many - furred creature brought to him , and then he saw the white finger , and the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance . then he took her hand and held her tightly , and as she was trying to get away , she undid the fur - cloak a little bit and the star - dress shone out . the king seized the cloak and tore it off her . her golden hair came down , and she stood there in her full splendour , and could not hide herself away any more . and when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face , she looked more beautiful than anyone in the world . but the king said , ' you are my dear bride , and we will never be separated from one another . ' so the wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after .
