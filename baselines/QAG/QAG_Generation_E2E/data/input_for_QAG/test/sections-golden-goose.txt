there was once a man who had three sons . the youngest of them was called dullhead , and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity . one day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood , and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine , so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst . when he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him ' good - morning , ' and said : ' do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket , and let me have a draught of your wine - i am so hungry and thirsty . '
but this clever son replied : ' if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none left for myself ; you just go your own way ; ' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest . there he began to cut down a tree , but before long he made a false stroke with his axe , and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up . then the second son went to the forest , and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother . he too met the little old grey man , who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine . but the second son spoke most sensibly too , and said : ' whatever i give to you i deprive myself of . just go your own way , will you ? ' not long after his punishment overtook him , for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe , than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home .
so then dullhead said : ' father , let me go out and cut wood . ' but his father answered : ' both your brothers have injured themselves . you had better leave it alone ; you know nothing about it . ' but dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said : ' very well , then - go . perhaps when you have hurt yourself , you may learn to know better . ' his mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders , and a bottle of sour beer .
when he got to the forest , he too met the little grey old man , who greeted him and said : ' give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle ; i am so hungry and thirsty . ' and dullhead replied : ' i 've only got a cinder - cake and some sour beer , but if you care to have that , let us sit down and eat . ' so they sat down , and when dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake , and the sour beer into excellent wine . then they ate and drank , and when they had finished the little man said : ' now i will bring you luck , because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others . there stands an old tree ; cut it down , and amongst its roots you 'll find something . ' with that the little man took leave .
then dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree , and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose , whose feathers were all of pure gold . he lifted it out , carried it off , and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night . now the landlord of the inn had three daughters , and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be , and each longed to have one of its golden feathers . the eldest thought to herself : ' no doubt i shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers , ' and the first time dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing . but , lo and behold ! her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose , and she could not take her hand away .
soon after the second daughter came in , and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too ; but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well . at last the third sister came with the same intentions , but the other two cried out : ' keep off ! for heaven 's sake , keep off ! ' the younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off , and thought to herself : ' if they are both there , why should not i be there too ? ' so she sprang to them ; but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her . so they all three had to spend the night with the goose .
next morning dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and went off , without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it . they just had to run after him right or left as best they could . in the middle of a field they met the parson , and when he saw this procession he cried : ' for shame , you bold girls ! what do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that ? do you call that proper behaviour ? ' and with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away . but directly he touched her he hung on himself , and had to run along with the rest of them . not long after the clerk came that way , and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls . ' why , where is your reverence going so fast ? ' cried he ; ' do n't forget there is to be a christening to - day ; ' and he ran after him , caught him by the sleeve , and hung on to it himself : as the five of them trotted along in this fashion one after the other , two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes . on seeing them the parson called out and begged them to come and rescue him and the clerk . but no sooner did they touch the clerk than they stuck on too , and so there were seven of them running after dullhead and his goose .
after a time they all came to a town where a king reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh . so the king had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her . when dullhead heard this he marched before the princess with his goose and its appendages , and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing , and could not stop herself . then dullhead claimed her as his bride , but the king , who did not much fancy him as a son - in - law , made all sorts of objections , and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine . dullhead bethought him of the little grey man , who could , he felt sure , help him ; so he went off to the forest , and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face .
dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart , and the man answered : ' i do n't know how i am ever to quench this terrible thirst i am suffering from . cold water does n't suit me at all . to be sure i 've emptied a whole barrel of wine , but what is one drop on a hot stone ? ' ' i think i can help you , ' said dullhead . ' come with me , and you shall drink to your heart 's content . ' so he took him to the king 's cellar , and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed .
then dullhead asked once more for his bride , but the king felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called ' dullhead ' carrying off his daughter , and he began to make fresh conditions . he required dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread . dullhead did not wait to consider long but went straight off to the forest , and there on the same spot sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body , and making a most woeful face the while . said he : ' i 've eaten up a whole oven full of loaves , but what 's the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as i am ? i declare my stomach feels quite empty , and i must draw my belt tight if i 'm not to die of starvation . ' dullhead was delighted , and said : ' get up and come with me , and you shall have plenty to eat , ' and he brought him to the king 's court .
now the king had given orders to have all the flour in his kingdom brought together , and to have a huge mountain baked of it . but the man from the wood just took up his stand before the mountain and began to eat , and in one day it had all vanished . for the third time dullhead asked for his bride , but again the king tried to make some evasion , and demanded a ship ' which could sail on land or water ! when you come sailing in such a ship , ' said he , ' you shall have my daughter without further delay . '
again dullhead started off to the forest , and there he found the little old grey man with whom he had shared his cake , and who said : ' i have eaten and i have drunk for you , and now i will give you the ship . i have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me . ' then he gave dullhead a ship which could sail on land or water , and when the king saw it he felt he could no longer refuse him his daughter . so they celebrated the wedding with great rejoicings ; and after the king 's death dullhead succeeded to the kingdom , and lived happily with his wife for many years after .
