at the foot of some high mountains there was , once upon a time , a small village , and a little way off two roads met , one of them going to the east and the other to the west . the villagers were quiet , hard - working folk , who toiled in the fields all day , and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church . in the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture , and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset . one summer night , when a round full moon shone down upon the white road , a great wolf came trotting round the corner .
' i positively must get a good meal before i go back to my den , ' he said to himself ; ' it is nearly a week since i have tasted anything but scraps , though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure ! of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains ; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them , and i am not so young as i was ! if i could only dine off that fox i saw a fortnight ago , curled up into a delicious hairy ball , i should ask nothing better ; i would have eaten her then , but unluckily her husband was lying beside her , and one knows that foxes , great and small , run like the wind . really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf , and , as the proverb says : ' one wolf does not bite another . ' however , let us see what this village can produce . i am as hungry as a schoolmaster . ' now , while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf , the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road .
' the whole of this day i have listened to those village hens clucking till i could bear it no longer , ' murmured she as she bounded along , hardly seeming to touch the ground . ' when you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music . as sure as there is a sun in heaven i will have some of them this night , for i have grown so thin that my very bones rattle , and my poor babies are crying for food . ' and as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass , where the two roads joined , and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest , and to settle her plans . at this moment the wolf came up .
at the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water , but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was . the fox 's quick ears heard the sound of his paws , though they were soft as velvet , and turning her head she said politely : ' is that you , neighbour ? what a strange place to meet in ! i hope you are quite well ? ' ' quite well as regards my health , ' answered the wolf , whose eye glistened greedily , ' at least , as well as one can be when one is very hungry . but what is the matter with you ? a fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish ! ' ' i have been ill - very ill , ' replied the fox , ' and what you say is quite true . a worm is fat in comparison with me . '
he is . still , you are good enough for me ; for ' to the hungry no bread is hard . ' ' oh , you are always joking ! i 'm sure you are not half as hungry as i ! ' ' that we shall soon see , ' cried the wolf , opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring . ' what are you doing ? ' exclaimed the fox , stepping backwards . ' what am i doing ? what i am going to do is to make my supper off you , in less time than a cock takes to crow . ' ' well , i suppose you must have your joke , ' answered the fox lightly , but never removing her eye from the wolf , who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth : ' i do n't want to joke , but to eat ! ' ' but surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all ! ' ' in this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest , ' replied the wolf . ' ah ! how true that is ; but- ' ' i ca n't stop to listen to your ' buts ' and ' yets , ' broke in the wolf rudely ; ' let us get to the point , and the point is that i want to eat you and not talk to you . ' ' have you no pity for a poor mother ? ' asked the fox , putting her tail to her eyes , but peeping slily out of them all the same .
' i am dying of hunger , ' answered the wolf , doggedly ; ' and you know , ' he added with a grin , ' that charity begins at home . ' ' quite so , ' replied the fox ; ' it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense . but if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice , the mother offers you one last request . ' ' then be quick and do n't waste my time , for i ca n't wait much longer . what is it you want ? ' ' you must know , ' said the fox , ' that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year , and keeps them in an old well , now dry , in his courtyard . by the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used , in former days , to draw up water . for many nights i have crept down to the palace , and have lowered myself in the bucket , bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children . all i beg of you is to come with me , and , instead of hunting chickens and such things , i will make a good meal off cheese before i die . ' ' but the cheeses may be all finished by now ? ' ' if you were only to see the quantities of them ! ' laughed the fox . ' and even if they were finished , there would always be me to eat . ' ' well , i will come . lead the way , but i warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host - that is to say , without my legs , which are as long as yours ! '
all was silent in the village , and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon , which shone bright and clear in the sky . the wolf and the fox crept softly along , when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other ; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses , and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs , who began to bark greedily . ' is it safe to go on , think you ? ' asked the wolf in a whisper . and the fox shook her head . ' not while the dogs are barking , ' said she ; ' someone might come out to see if anything was the matter . ' and she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her . in about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking , or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them . then the wolf and the fox jumped up , and hastened to the foot of the wall .
' i am lighter than he is , ' thought the fox to herself , ' and perhaps if i make haste i can get a start , and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one . ' and she quickened her pace . but if the wolf could not run he could jump , and with one bound he was beside his companion . ' what were you going to do , comrade ? ' ' oh , nothing , ' replied the fox , much vexed at the failure of her plan . ' i think if i were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better , ' said the wolf , giving a snap at her as he spoke . the fox drew back uneasily . ' be careful , or i shall scream , ' she snarled . and the wolf , understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat , gave a signal to his companion to leap on the wall , where he immediately followed her .
once on the top they crouched down and looked about them . not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard , and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well , with its two buckets suspended from a pole , just as the fox had described it . the two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along the wall till they were opposite the well , and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom , but just enough to reflect the moon , big , and round and yellow . ' how lucky ! ' cried she to the wolf . ' there is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel . look ! look ! did you ever see anything so beautiful ! '
' never ! ' answered the wolf , peering over in his turn , his eyes glistening greedily , for he imagined that the moon 's reflection in the water was really a cheese . ' and now , unbeliever , what have you to say ? ' and the fox laughed gently . ' that you are a woman - i mean a fox - of your word , ' replied the wolf . ' well , then , go down in that bucket and eat your fill , ' said the fox . ' oh , is that your game ? ' asked the wolf , with a grin . ' no ! no ! the person who goes down in the bucket will be you ! and if you do n't go down your head will go without you ! ' ' of course i will go down , with the greatest pleasure , ' answered the fox , who had expected the wolf 's reply . ' and be sure you do n't eat all the cheese , or it will be the worse for you , ' continued the wolf . but the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes . ' farewell , suspicious one ! ' she said sadly . and climbed into the bucket . in an instant she had reached the bottom of the well , and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs .
' why , it is larger and richer than i thought , ' cried she , turning towards the wolf , who was leaning over the wall of the well . ' then be quick and bring it up , ' commanded the wolf . ' how can i , when it weighs more than i do ? ' asked the fox . ' if it is so heavy bring it in two bits , of course , ' said he . ' but i have no knife , ' answered the fox . ' you will have to come down yourself , and we will carry it up between us . ' ' and how am i to come down ? ' inquired the wolf . ' oh , you are really very stupid ! get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head . ' the wolf looked up , and saw the bucket hanging there , and with some difficulty he climbed into it . as he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk , and the other bucket , in which the fox was seated , came to the surface .
as soon as he understood what was happening , the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf , but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him . ' but where is the cheese ? ' he asked of the fox , who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile . ' the cheese ? ' answered the fox ; ' why i am taking it home to my babies , who are too young to get food for themselves . ' ' ah , traitor ! ' cried the wolf , howling with rage . but the fox was not there to hear this insult , for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl - house , where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before . ' perhaps i did treat him rather badly , ' she said to herself . ' but it seems getting cloudy , and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom , and his will go up - at least it may ! '
