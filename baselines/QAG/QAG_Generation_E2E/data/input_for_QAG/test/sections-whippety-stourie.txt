i am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman , who lived in a house called kittlerumpit , though whereabouts in scotland the house of kittlerumpit stood nobody knows . some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the debateable land , which , as all the world knows , was on the borders , where the old border reivers were constantly coming and going ; the scotch stealing from the english , and the english from the scotch . be that as it may , the widowed mistress of kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied . for she had lost her husband , and no one quite knew what had become of him . he had gone to a fair one day , and had never come back again , and although everybody believed that he was dead , no one knew how he died . some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist , and had been killed in the wars ; others , that he had been taken away to serve as a sailor by the press - gang , and had been drowned at sea .
at any rate , his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied , for she was left with a little baby - boy to bring up , and , as times were bad , she had not much to live on . but she loved her baby dearly , and worked all day amongst her cows , and pigs , and hens , in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothes for both herself and him . now , on the morning of which i am speaking , she rose very early and went out to feed her pigs , for rent - day was coming on , and she intended to take one of them , a great , big , fat creature , to the market that very day , as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent . and because she thought so , her heart was light , and she hummed a little song to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm and her baby - boy on the other .
but the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reached the pig - stye , for there lay her cherished pig on its back , with its legs in the air and its eyes shut , just as if it were going to breathe its last breath . " what shall i do ? what shall i do ? " cried the poor woman , sitting down on a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast , heedless of the fact that she had dropped her bucket , and that the pig's - meat was running out , and that the hens were eating it . " first i lost my husband , and now i am going to lose my finest pig . the pig that i hoped would fetch a deal of money . " now i must explain to you that the house of kittlerumpit stood on a hillside , with a great fir wood behind it , and the ground sloping down steeply in front .
and as the poor young thing , after having a good cry to herself , was drying her eyes , she chanced to look down the hill , and who should she see coming up it but an old woman , who looked like a lady born . she was dressed all in green , with a white apron , and she wore a black velvet hood on her head , and a steeple - crowned beaver hat over that , something like those , as i have heard tell , that the women wear in wales . she walked very slowly , leaning on a long staff , and she gave a bit hirple now and then , as if she were lame . as she drew near , the young widow felt it was becoming to rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman , for such she saw her to be .
" madam , " she said , with a sob in her voice , " i bid you welcome to the house of kittlerumpit , although you find its mistress one of the most unfortunate women in the world . " " hout - tout , " answered the old lady , in such a harsh voice that the young woman started , and grasped her baby tighter in her arms . " ye have little need to say that . ye have lost your husband , i grant ye , but there were waur losses at shirra - muir . and now your pig is like to die -- i could , maybe , remedy that . but i must first hear how much ye wad gie me if i cured him . " " anything that your ladyship 's madam likes to ask , " replied the widow , too much delighted at having the animal 's life saved to think that she was making rather a rash promise . " very good , " said the old dame , and without wasting any more words she walked straight into the pig - sty .
she stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes , rocking to and fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not understand ; at least , she could only understand four of them , and they sounded something like this : " pitter - patter , haly water . " then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it . she took the cork out , and dropped one of her long lady - like fingers into it ; then she touched the pig on the snout and on his ears , and on the tip of his curly tail . no sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped , and , with a grunt of contentment , ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast .
a joyful woman was the mistress of kittlerumpit when she saw it do this , for she felt that her rent was safe ; and in her relief and gratitude she would have kissed the hem of the strange lady 's green gown , if she would have allowed it , but she would not . " no , no , " said she , and her voice sounded harsher than ever . " let us have no fine meanderings , but let us stick to our bargain . i have done my part , and mended the pig ; now ye must do yours , and give me what i like to ask -- your son . " then the poor widow gave a piteous cry , for she knew now what she had not guessed before -- that the green - clad lady was a fairy , and a wicked fairy too , else had she not asked such a terrible thing . it was too late now , however , to pray , and beseech , and beg for mercy ; the fairy stood her ground , hard and cruel .
" ye promised me what i liked to ask , and i have asked your son ; and your son i will have , " she replied , " so it is useless making such a din about it . but one thing i may tell you , for i know well that the knowledge will not help you . by the laws of fairy - land , i can not take the bairn till the third day after this , and if by that time you have found out my name i can not take him even then . but ye will not be able to find it out , of that i am certain . so i will call back for the boy in three days . " and with that she disappeared round the back of the pig - sty , and the poor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone . all that day , and all the next , she did nothing but sit in her kitchen and cry , and hug her baby tighter in her arms ; but on the day before that on which the fairy said that she was coming back , she felt as if she must get a little breath of fresh air , so she went for a walk in the fir wood behind the house .
now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole , in the bottom of which was a bonnie spring well , the water of which was always sweet and pure . the young widow was walking near this quarry hole , when , to her astonishment , she heard the whirr of a spinning - wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a song . at first she could not think where the sound came from ; then , remembering the quarry , she laid down her child at a tree root , and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the hole and peeped over . she could hardly believe her eyes ! for there , far below her , at the bottom of the quarry , beside the spring well , sat the cruel fairy , dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat , spinning away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning - wheel . and what should she be singing but-- " little kens our guid dame at hame , whippety - stourie is my name . "
the widow woman almost cried aloud for joy , for now she had learned the fairy 's secret , and her child was safe . but she dare not , in case the wicked old dame heard her and threw some other spell over her . so she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child ; then , catching him up in her arms , she ran through the wood to her house , laughing , and singing , and tossing him in the air in such a state of delight that , if anyone had met her , they would have been in danger of thinking that she was mad . now this young woman had been a merry - hearted maiden , and would have been merry - hearted still , if , since her marriage , she had not had so much trouble that it had made her grow old and sober - minded before her time ; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the fairy for a few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name .
so next day , at the appointed time , she went out with her boy in her arms , and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before ; and when she saw the old dame coming up the hill , she crumpled up her nice clean cap , and screwed up her face , and pretended to be in great distress and to be crying bitterly . the fairy took no notice of this , however , but came close up to her , and said , in her harsh , merciless voice , " good wife of kittlerumpit , ye ken the reason of my coming ; give me the bairn . " then the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever , and fell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy .
" oh , sweet madam mistress , " she cried , " spare me my bairn , and take , and thou wilt , the pig instead . " " we have no need of bacon where i come from , " answered the fairy coldly ; " so give me the laddie and let me begone -- i have no time to waste in this wise . " " oh , dear lady mine , " pleaded the goodwife , " if thou wilt not have the pig , wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself ? " the fairy stepped back a little , as if in astonishment . " art thou mad , woman , " she cried contemptuously , " that thou proposest such a thing ? who in all the world would care to take a plain - looking , red - eyed , dowdy wife like thee with them ? "
now the young mistress of kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty , and the knowledge had never vexed her ; but something in the fairy 's tone made her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer . " in troth , fair madam , i might have had the wit to know that the like of me is not fit to tie the shoe - string of the high and mighty princess , whippety - stourie ! " if there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground , and if it had suddenly exploded beneath her feet , the wicked fairy could not have jumped higher into air . and when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down the brae , shrieking with rage and disappointment , for all the world , as an old book says , " like an owl chased by witches . "
