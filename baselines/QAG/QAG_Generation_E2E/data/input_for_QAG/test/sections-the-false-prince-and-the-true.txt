the king had just awakened from his midday sleep , for it was summer , and everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three , as they do in hot countries . he had dressed himself in cool white clothes , and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber , when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him , and one amongst them stepped forward and spoke . ' sire , this morning we were all playing tennis in the court , the prince and this gentleman with the rest , when there broke out some dispute about the game . the prince lost his temper , and said many insulting things to the other , who was playing against him , till at length the gentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face , so that the blood ran from his mouth and nose . we were all so horrified at the sight , that we should most likely have killed the man then and there , for daring to lay hands on the prince , had not his grandfather the duke stepped between and commanded us to lay the affair before you . '
the king had listened attentively to the story , and when it was ended he said : ' i suppose the prince had no arms with him , or else he would have used them ? ' ' yes , sire , he had arms ; he always carries a dagger in his belt . but when he saw the blood pouring from his face , he went to a corner of the court and began to cry , which was the strangest thing of all . ' on hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a few minutes with his back to the room , where the company of young men remained silent . then he came back , his face white and stern . ' i tell you , ' he said , ' and it is the solemn truth , that i would rather you had told me that the prince was dead , though he is my only son , than know that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avenge it . as for the gentleman who struck him , he will be brought before my judges , and will plead his own cause , but i hardly think he can escape death , after having assaulted the heir to the crown . '
the young man raised his head as if to reply , but the king would not listen , and commanded his guards to put him under arrest , adding , however , that if the prisoner wished to visit any part of the city , he was at liberty to do so properly guarded , and in fifteen days he would be brought to trial before the highest judges in the land . the young man left the king 's presence , surrounded by soldiers , and accompanied by many of his friends , for he was a great favourite . by their advice he spent the fourteen days that remained to him going about to seek counsel from wise men of all sorts , as to how he might escape death , but no one could help him , for none could find any excuse for the blow he had given to the prince . the fourteenth night had come , and in despair the prisoner went out to take his last walk through the city . he wandered on hardly knowing where he went , and his face was so white and desperate that none of his companions dared speak to him . the sad little procession had passed some hours in this manner , when , near the gate of a monastery , an old woman appeared round a corner , and suddenly stood before the young man . she was bent almost double , and was so wizened and wrinkled that she looked at least ninety ; only her eyes were bright and quick as those of a girl .
' sir , ' she said , ' i know all that has happened to you , and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life . but there is none that can answer that question save only i myself , if you will promise to do all i ask . ' at her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled off him . ' oh , save me , and i will do anything ! ' he cried . ' it is so hard to leave the world and go out into the darkness . ' ' you will not need to do that , ' answered the old woman , ' you have only got to marry me , and you will soon be free . ' ' marry you ? ' exclaimed he , ' but -- but -- i am not yet twenty , and you --why , you must be a hundred at least ! oh , no , it is quite impossible . ' he spoke without thinking , but the flash of anger which darted from her eyes made him feel uncomfortable . however , all she said was : ' as you like ; since you reject me , let the crows have you , ' and hurried away down the street .
left to himself , the full horror of his coming death rushed upon the young man , and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance of life . well , if he must , he must , he said to himself , and began to run as fast as he could after the old crone , who by this time could scarcely be seen , even in the moonlight . who would have believed a woman past ninety could walk with such speed ? it seemed more like flying ! but at length , breathless and exhausted , he reached her side , and gasped out : ' madam , pardon me for my hasty words just now ; i was wrong , and will thankfully accept the offer you made me . ' ' ah , i thought you would come to your senses , ' answered she , in rather an odd voice . ' we have no time to lose -- follow me at once , ' and they went on silently and swiftly till they stopped at the door of a small house in which the priest lived . before him the old woman bade the prisoner swear that she should be his wife , and this he did in the presence of witnesses . then , begging the priest and the guards to leave them alone for a little , she told the young man what he was to do , when the next morning he was brought before the king and the judges .
the hall was full to overflowing when the prisoner entered it , and all marvelled at the brightness of his face . the king inquired if he had any excuse to plead for the high treason he had committed by striking the heir to the throne , and , if so , to be quick in setting it forth . with a low bow the youth made answer in a clear voice : ' o my lord and gracious king , and you , nobles and wise men of the land , i leave my cause without fear in your hands , knowing that you will listen and judge rightly , and that you will suffer me to speak to the end , before you give judgment . ' ' for four years , you , o king , had been married to the queen and yet had no children , which grieved you greatly . the queen saw this , and likewise that your love was going from her , and thought night and day of some plan that might put an end to this evil . at length , when you were away fighting in distant countries , she decided what she would do , and adopted in secret the baby of a poor quarryman , sending a messenger to tell you that you had a son . no one suspected the truth except a priest to whom the queen confessed the truth , and in a few weeks she fell ill and died , leaving the baby to be brought up as became a prince . and now , if your highness will permit me , i will speak of myself . ' ' what you have already told me , ' answered the king , ' is so strange that i can not imagine what more there is to tell , but go on with your story . '
' one day , shortly after the death of the queen , ' continued the young man , ' your highness was hunting , and outstripped all your attendants while chasing the deer . you were in a part of the country which you did not know , so seeing an orchard all pink and white with apple - blossoms , and a girl tossing a ball in one corner , you went up to her to ask your way . but when she turned to answer you , you were so struck with her beauty that all else fled from your mind . again and again you rode back to see her , and at length persuaded her to marry you . she only thought you a poor knight , and agreed that as you wished it , the marriage should be kept secret . ' ' after the ceremony you gave her three rings and a charm with a cross on it , and then put her in a cottage in the forest , thinking to hide the matter securely . ' ' for some months you visited the cottage every week ; but a rebellion broke out in a distant part of the kingdom , and called for your presence . when next you rode up to the cottage , it was empty , and none could inform you whither your bride had gone . that , sire , i can now tell you , ' and the young man paused and looked at the king , who coloured deeply . ' she went back to her father the old duke , once your chamberlain , and the cross on her breast revealed at once who you were . fierce was his anger when he heard his daughter 's tale , and he vowed that he would hide her safely from you , till the day when you would claim her publicly as your queen . '
' by and bye i was born , and was brought up by my grandfather in one of his great houses . here are the rings you gave to my mother , and here is the cross , and these will prove if i am your son or not . ' as he spoke the young man laid the jewels at the feet of the king , and the nobles and the judges pressed round to examine them . the king alone did not move from his seat , for he had forgotten the hall of justice and all about him , and saw only the apple - orchard , as it was twenty years ago , and the beautiful girl playing at ball . a sudden silence round him made him look up , and he found the eyes of the assembly fixed on him . ' it is true ; it is he who is my son , and not the other , ' he said with an effort , ' and let every man present swear to acknowledge him as king , after my death . ' therefore one by one they all knelt before him and took the oath , and a message was sent to the false prince , forbidding him ever again to appear at court , though a handsome pension was granted him .
at last the ceremony was over , and the king , signing to his newly found son to follow him , rose and went into another room . ' tell me how you knew all that , ' he said , throwing himself into a carved chair filled with crimson cushions , and the prince told of his meeting with the old woman who had brought him the jewels from his mother , and how he had sworn before a priest to marry her , though he did not want to do it , on account of the difference in their ages , and besides , he would rather receive a bride chosen by the king himself . but the king frowned , and answered sharply : ' you swore to marry her if she saved your life , and , come what may , you must fulfil your promise . ' then , striking a silver shield that hung close by , he said to the equerry who appeared immediately : ' go and seek the priest who lives near the door of the prison , and ask him where you can find the old woman who visited him last night ; and when you have found her , bring her to the palace . '
it took some time to discover the whereabouts of the old woman , but at length it was accomplished , and when she arrived at the palace with the equerry , she was received with royal honours , as became the bride of the prince . the guards looked at each other with astonished eyes , as the wizened creature , bowed with age , passed between their lines ; but they were more amazed still at the lightness of her step as she skipped up the steps to the great door before which the king was standing , with the prince at his side . if they both felt a shock at the appearance of the aged lady they did not show it , and the king , with a grave bow , took her band , and led her to the chapel , where a bishop was waiting to perform the marriage ceremony . for the next few weeks little was seen of the prince , who spent all his days in hunting , and trying to forget the old wife at home . as for the princess , no one troubled himself about her , and she passed the days alone in her apartments , for she had absolutely declined the services of the ladies - in - waiting whom the king had appointed for her .
one night the prince returned after a longer chase than usual , and he was so tired that he went up straight to bed . suddenly he was awakened by a strange noise in the room , and suspecting that a robber might have stolen in , he jumped out of bed , and seized his sword , which lay ready to his hand . then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the next room , which belonged to the princess , and was lighted by a burning torch . creeping softly to the door , he peeped through it , and beheld her lying quietly , with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head , her wrinkles all gone , and her face , which was whiter than the snow , as fresh as that of a girl of fourteen . could that really be his wife -- that beautiful , beautiful creature ? the prince was still gazing in surprise when the lady opened her eyes and smiled at him . ' yes , i really am your wife , ' she said , as if she had guessed his thoughts , ' and the enchantment is ended . now i must tell you who i am , and what befell to cause me to take the shape of an old woman . '
' the king of granada is my father , and i was born in the palace which overlooks the plain of the vega . i was only a few months old when a wicked fairy , who had a spite against my parents , cast a spell over me , bending my back and wrinkling my skin till i looked as if i was a hundred years old , and making me such an object of disgust to everyone , that at length the king ordered my nurse to take my away from the palace . she was the only person who cared about me , and we lived together in this city on a small pension allowed me by the king . ' ' when i was about three an old man arrived at our house , and begged my nurse to let him come in and rest , as he could walk no longer . she saw that he was very ill , so put him to bed and took such care of him that by and bye he was as strong as ever . in gratitude for her goodness to him , he told her that he was a wizard and could give her anything she chose to ask for , except life or death , so she answered that what she longed for most in the world was that my wrinkled skin should disappear , and that i should regain the beauty with which i was born . to this he replied that as my misfortune resulted from a spell , this was rather difficult , but he would do his best , and at any rate he could promise that before my fifteenth birthday i should be freed from the enchantment if i could get a man who would swear to marry me as i was . '
' as you may suppose , this was not easy , as my ugliness was such that no one would look at me a second time . my nurse and i were almost in despair , as my fifteenth birthday was drawing near , and i had never so much as spoken to a man . at last we received a visit from the wizard , who told us what had happened at court , and your story , bidding me to put myself in your way when you had lost all hope , and offer to save you if you would consent to marry me . ' ' that is my history , and now you must beg the king to send messengers at once to granada , to inform my father of our marriage , and i think , ' she added with a smile , ' that he will not refuse us his blessing .
