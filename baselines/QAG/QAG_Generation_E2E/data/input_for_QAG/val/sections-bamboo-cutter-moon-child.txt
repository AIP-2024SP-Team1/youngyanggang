long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood - cutter . he was very poor and sad also , for no child had heaven sent to cheer his old age , and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave . every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky . when he had made his choice , he would cut down these feathers of the forest , and splitting them lengthwise , or cutting them into joints , would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household , and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them .
one morning as usual he had gone out to his work , and having found a nice clump of bamboos , had set to work to cut some of them down . suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light , as if the full moon had risen over the spot . looking round in astonishment , he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo . the old man , full of wonder , dropped his ax and went towards the light . on nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from a hollow in the green bamboo stem , and still more wonderful to behold , in the midst of the brilliance stood a tiny human being , only three inches in height , and exquisitely beautiful in appearance .
" you must be sent to be my child , for i find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily work , " said the old man , and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his wife to bring up . the tiny girl was so exceedingly beautiful and so small , that the old woman put her into a basket to safeguard her from the least possibility of being hurt in any way . the old couple were now very happy , for it had been a lifelong regret that they had no children of their own , and with joy they now expended all the love of their old age on the little child who had come to them in so marvelous a manner .
from this time on , the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed them down and cut them up ; not only gold , but precious stones also , so that by degrees he became rich . he built himself a fine house , and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter , but as a wealthy man . three months passed quickly away , and in that time the bamboo child had , wonderful to say , become a full - grown girl , so her foster - parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos . she was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess , and allowed no one to see her , waiting upon her themselves . it seemed as if she were made of light , for the house was filled with a soft shining , so that even in the dark of night it was like daytime . her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there . whenever the old man felt sad , he had only to look upon his foster - daughter and his sorrow vanished , and he became as happy as when he was a youth .
at last the day came for the naming of their new - found child , so the old couple called in a celebrated name - giver , and he gave her the name of princess moonlight , because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the moon god . for three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music . all the friends and relations of the old couple were present , and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of princess moonlight . everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely ; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her , so they said . the fame of the princess 's loveliness spread far and wide , and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand , or even so much as to see her .
suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house , and made little holes in the fence , in the hope of catching a glimpse of the princess as she went from one room to the other along the veranda . they stayed there day and night , sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her , but all in vain . then they approached the house , and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants , but not even this was granted them . still , in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day , and night after night , and counted it as nothing , so great was their desire to see the princess .
at last , however , most of the men , seeing how hopeless their quest was , lost heart and hope both , and returned to their homes . all except five knights , whose ardor and determination , instead of waning , seemed to wax greater with obstacles . these five men even went without their meals , and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them , so that they might always stand outside the dwelling . they stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain . sometimes they wrote letters to the princess , but no answer was vouchsafed to them . then when letters failed to draw any reply , they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love which kept them from sleep , from food , from rest , and even from their homes . still princes moonlight gave no sign of having received their verses .
in this hopeless state the winter passed . the snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave place to the gentle warmth of spring . then the summer came , and the sun burned white and scorching in the heavens above and on the earth beneath , and still these faithful knights kept watch and waited . at the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo - cutter and entreated him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the princess , but he answered only that as he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes .
the five knights on receiving this stern answer returned to their several homes , and pondered over the best means of touching the proud princess 's heart , even so much as to grant them a hearing . they took their rosaries in hand and knelt before their household shrines , and burned precious incense , praying to buddha to give them their heart 's desire . thus several days passed , but even so they could not rest in their homes .
so again they set out for the bamboo - cutter 's house . this time the old man came out to see them , and they asked him to let them know if it was the princess 's resolution never to see any man whatsoever , and they implored him to speak for them and to tell her the greatness of their love , and how long they had waited through the cold of winter and the heat of summer , sleepless and roofless through all weathers , without food and without rest , in the ardent hope of winning her , and they were willing to consider this long vigil as pleasure if she would but give them one chance of pleading their cause with her .
the old man lent a willing ear to their tale of love , for in his inmost heart he felt sorry for these faithful suitors and would have liked to see his lovely foster - daughter married to one of them . so he went in to princess moonlight and said reverently : " although you have always seemed to me to be a heavenly being , yet i have had the trouble of bringing you up as my own child and you have been glad of the protection of my roof . will you refuse to do as i wish ? "
then princess moonlight replied that there was nothing she would not do for him , that she honored and loved him as her own father , and that as for herself she could not remember the time before she came to earth . the old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words . then he told her how anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died . " i am an old man , over seventy years of age , and my end may come any time now . it is necessary and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them . " " oh , why , " said the princess in distress , " must i do this ? i have no wish to marry now . "
" i found you , " answered the old man , " many years ago , when you were a little creature three inches high , in the midst of a great white light . the light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you . so i have always thought that you were more than mortal woman . while i am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so , but some day i shall cease to be and who will take care of you then ? therefore i pray you to meet these five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them ! " then the princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be , and that even if she consented to marry any one of them , not really knowing her before , his heart might change afterwards . so as she did not feel sure of them , even though her father told her they were worthy knights , she did not feel it wise to see them .
" all you say is very reasonable , " said the old man , " but what kind of men will you consent to see ? i do not call these five men who have waited on you for months , light - hearted . they have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer , often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you . what more can you demand ? " then princess moonlight said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her . the five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess .
that same evening the suitors arrived and began to play their flutes in turn , and to sing their self - composed songs telling of their great and tireless love . the bamboo - cutter went out to them and offered them his sympathy for all they had endured and all the patience they had shown in their desire to win his foster - daughter . then he gave them her message , that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted . this was to test them . the five all accepted the trial , and thought it an excellent plan , for it would prevent jealousy between them .
princess moonlight then sent word to the first knight that she requested him to bring her the stone bowl which had belonged to buddha in india . the second knight was asked to go to the mountain of horai , said to be situated in the eastern sea , and to bring her a branch of the wonderful tree that grew on its summit . the roots of this tree were of silver , the trunk of gold , and the branches bore as fruit white jewels . the third knight was told to go to china and search for the fire - rat and to bring her its skin . the fourth knight was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating five colors and to bring the stone to her . the fifth knight was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring the shell to her .
the old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages , but the princess would make no other conditions . so her commands were issued word for word to the five men who , when they heard what was required of them , were all disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given them and returned to their own homes in despair . but after a time , when they thought of the princess , the love in their hearts revived for her , and they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them .
the first knight sent word to the princess that he was starting out that day on the quest of buddha 's bowl , and he hoped soon to bring it to her . but he had not the courage to go all the way to india , for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger , so he went to one of the temples in kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there , paying the priest a large sum of money for it . he then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and , waiting quietly for three years , returned and carried it to the old man .
princess moonlight wondered that the knight should have returned so soon . she took the bowl from its gold wrapping , expecting it to make the room full of light , but it did not shine at all , so she knew that it was a sham thing and not the true bowl of buddha . she returned it at once and refused to see him . the knight threw the bowl away and returned to his home in despair . he gave up now all hopes of ever winning the princess .
the second knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health , for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the princess moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them . he then left his home , at the same time sending word to the princess that he was setting out for mount horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have . he only allowed his servants to accompany him half - way , and then sent them back . he reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship , and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it . he then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers , and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the princess as having come from the wonderful tree growing on mount horai . every one whom he had asked declared that mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact .
when the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel . he put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo - cutter , begging him to present it to the princess . the old man was quite deceived by the travel - stained appearance of the knight , and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch . so he tried to persuade the princess to consent to see the man . but she remained silent and looked very sad . the old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land . then he spoke of the knight , how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the mount of horai .
princess moonlight took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully . she then told her foster - parent that she knew it was impossible for the man to have obtained a branch from the gold and silver tree growing on mount horai so quickly or so easily , and she was sorry to say she believed it artificial . the old man then went out to the expectant knight , who had now approached the house , and asked where he had found the branch . then the man did not scruple to make up a long story .
" two years ago i took a ship and started in search of mount horai . after going before the wind for some time i reached the far eastern sea . then a great storm arose and i was tossed about for many days , losing all count of the points of the compass , and finally we were blown ashore on an unknown island . here i found the place inhabited by demons who at one time threatened to kill and eat me . however , i managed to make friends with these horrible creatures , and they helped me and my sailors to repair the boat , and i set sail again . our food gave out , and we suffered much from sickness on board . at last , on the five - hundredth day from the day of starting , i saw far off on the horizon what looked like the peak of a mountain . on nearer approach , this proved to be an island , in the center of which rose a high mountain . i landed , and after wandering about for two or three days , i saw a shining being coming towards me on the beach , holding in his hands a golden bowl . i went up to him and asked him if i had , by good chance , found the island of mount horai , and he answered : " " yes , this is mount horai ! "
" with much difficulty i climbed to the summit , here stood the golden tree growing with silver roots in the ground . the wonders of that strange land are many , and if i began to tell you about them i could never stop . in spite of my wish to stay there long , on breaking off the branch i hurried back . with utmost speed it has taken me four hundred days to get back , and , as you see , my clothes are still damp from exposure on the long sea voyage . i have not even waited to change my raiment , so anxious was i to bring the branch to the princess quickly . "
just at this moment the six jewelers , who had been employed on the making of the branch , but not yet paid by the knight , arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the princess to be paid for their labor . they said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the branch of gold , with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit , that was now presented to her by the knight , but as yet they had received nothing in payment . so this knight 's deception was thus found out , and the princess , glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor , was only too pleased to send back the branch . she called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy . but on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man , who beat them till they were nearly dead , for letting out the secret , and they barely escaped with their lives . the knight then returned home , raging in his heart ; and in despair of ever winning the princess gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains .
now the third knight had a friend in china , so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire - rat . the virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it . he promised his friend any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article . as soon as the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port , he rode seven days on horseback to meet him . he handed his friend a large sum of money , and received the fire - rat 's skin . when he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the princess while he waited outside for her answer .
the bamboo - cutter took the box from the knight and , as usual , carried it in to her and tried to coax her to see the knight at once , but princess moonlight refused , saying that she must first put the skin to test by putting it into the fire . if it were the real thing it would not burn . so she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box , and then threw the skin into the fire . the skin crackled and burnt up at once , and the princess knew that this man also had not fulfilled his word . so the third knight failed also . now the fourth knight was no more enterprising than the rest . instead of starting out on the quest of the dragon bearing on its head the five - color - radiating jewel , he called all his servants together and gave them the order to seek for it far and wide in japan and in china , and he strictly forbade any of them to return till they had found it .
his numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions , with no intention , however , of obeying what they considered an impossible order . they simply took a holiday , went to pleasant country places together , and grumbled at their master 's unreasonableness . the knight meanwhile , thinking that his retainers could not fail to find the jewel , repaired to his house , and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the princess , he felt so sure of winning her . one year passed away in weary waiting , and still his men did not return with the dragon - jewel . the knight became desperate . he could wait no longer , so taking with him only two men he hired a ship and commanded the captain to go in search of the dragon ; the captain and the sailors refused to undertake what they said was an absurd search , but the knight compelled them at last to put out to sea .
when they had been but a few days out they encountered a great storm which lasted so long that , by the time its fury abated , the knight had determined to give up the hunt of the dragon . they were at last blown on shore , for navigation was primitive in those days . worn out with his travels and anxiety , the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest . he had caught a very heavy cold , and had to go to bed with a swollen face . the governor of the place , hearing of his plight , sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house . while he was there thinking over all his troubles , his love for the princess turned to anger , and he blamed her for all the hardships he had undergone . he thought that it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him , and in order to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest .
at this point all the servants he had sent out to find the jewel came to see him , and were surprised to find praise instead of displeasure awaiting them . their master told them that he was heartily sick of adventure , and said that he never intended to go near the princess 's house again in the future . like all the rest , the fifth knight failed in his quest - he could not find the swallow 's shell . by this time the fame of princess moonlight 's beauty had reached the ears of the emperor , and he sent one of the court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said ; if so he would summon her to the palace and make her one of the ladies - in - waiting .
when the court lady arrived , in spite of her father 's entreaties , princess moonlight refused to see her . the imperial messenger insisted , saying it was the emperor 's order . then princess moonlight told the old man that if she was forced to go to the palace in obedience to the emperor 's order , she would vanish from the earth . when the emperor was told of her persistence in refusing to obey his summons , and that if pressed to obey she would disappear altogether from sight , he determined to go and see her . so he planned to go on a hunting excursion in the neighborhood of the bamboo - cutter 's house , and see the princess himself . he sent word to the old man of his intention , and he received consent to the scheme . the next day the emperor set out with his retinue , which he soon managed to outride . he found the bamboo - cutter 's house and dismounted . he then entered the house and went straight to where the princess was sitting with her attendant maidens .
never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful , and he could not but look at her , for she was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft radiance . when princess moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room , but the emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say . her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves . the emperor fell deeply in love with her , and begged her to come to the court , where he would give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for . he was about to send for one of the imperial palanquins to take her back with him at once , saying that her grace and beauty should adorn a court , and not be hidden in a bamboo - cutter 's cottage .
but the princess stopped him . she said that if she were forced to go to the palace she would turn at once into a shadow , and even as she spoke she began to lose her form . her figure faded from his sight while he looked . the emperor then promised to leave her free if only she would resume her former shape , which she did .
it was now time for him to return , for his retinue would be wondering what had happened to their royal master when they missed him for so long . so he bade her good - by , and left the house with a sad heart . princess moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world ; all others were dark beside her , and he thought of her night and day . his majesty now spent much of his time in writing poems , telling her of his love and devotion , and sent them to her , and though she refused to see him again she answered with many verses of her own composing , which told him gently and kindly that she could never marry any one on this earth . these little songs always gave him pleasure . at this time her foster - parents noticed that night after night the princess would sit on her balcony and gaze for hours at the moon , in a spirit of the deepest dejection , ending always in a burst of tears . one night the old man found her thus weeping as if her heart were broken , and he besought her to tell him the reason of her sorrow .
with many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong to this world - that she had in truth come from the moon , and that her time on earth would soon be over . on the fifteenth day of that very month of august her friends from the moon would come to fetch her , and she would have to return . her parents were both there , but having spent a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them , and also the moon - world to which she belonged . it made her weep , she said , to think of leaving her kind foster - parents , and the home where she had been happy for so long . when her attendants heard this they were very sad , and could not eat or drink for sadness at the thought that the princess was so soon to leave them . the emperor , as soon as the news was carried to him , sent messengers to the house to find out if the report were true or not .
the old bamboo - cutter went out to meet the imperial messengers . the last few days of sorrow had told upon the old man ; he had aged greatly , and looked much more than his seventy years . weeping bitterly , he told them that the report was only too true , but he intended , however , to make prisoners of the envoys from the moon , and to do all he could to prevent the princess from being carried back . the men returned and told his majesty all that had passed . on the fifteenth day of that month the emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house . one thousand stationed themselves on the roof , another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house . all were well trained archers , with bows and arrows . the bamboo - cutter and his wife hid princess moonlight in an inner room .
the old man gave orders that no one was to sleep that night , all in the house were to keep a strict watch , and be ready to protect the princess . with these precautions , and the help of the emperor 's men - at - arms , he hoped to withstand the moon - messengers , but the princess told him that all these measures to keep her would be useless , and that when her people came for her nothing whatever could prevent them from carrying out their purpose . even the emperors men would be powerless . then she added with tears that she was very , very sorry to leave him and his wife , whom she had learned to love as her parents , that if she could do as she liked she would stay with them in their old age , and try to make some return for all the love and kindness they had showered upon her during all her earthly life . the night wore on ! the yellow harvest moon rose high in the heavens , flooding the world asleep with her golden light . silence reigned over the pine and the bamboo forests , and on the roof where the thousand men - at - arms waited .
then the night grew gray towards the dawn and all hoped that the danger was over - that princess moonlight would not have to leave them after all . then suddenly the watchers saw a cloud form round the moon - and while they looked this cloud began to roll earthwards . nearer and nearer it came , and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house . in a short time the sky was entirely obscured , till at last the cloud lay over the dwelling only ten feet off the ground . in the midst of the cloud there stood a flying chariot , and in the chariot a band of luminous beings . one amongst them who looked like a king and appeared to be the chief stepped out of the chariot , and , poised in air , called to the old man to come out .
" the time has come , " he said , " for princess moonlight to return to the moon from whence she came . she committed a grave fault , and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time . we know what good care you have taken of the princess , and we have rewarded you for this and have sent you wealth and prosperity . we put the gold in the bamboos for you to find . " " i have brought up this princess for twenty years and never once has she done a wrong thing , therefore the lady you are seeking can not be this one , " said the old man . " i pray you to look elsewhere . " then the messenger called aloud , saying : " princess moonlight , come out from this lowly dwelling . rest not here another moment . "
at these words the screens of the princess 's room slid open of their own accord , revealing the princess shining in her own radiance , bright and wonderful and full of beauty . the messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot . she looked back , and saw with pity the deep sorrow of the old man . she spoke to him many comforting words , and told him that it was not her will to leave him and that he must always think of her when looking at the moon . the bamboo - cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her , but this was not allowed . the princess took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake .
one of the moon beings in the chariot held a wonderful coat of wings , another had a phial full of the elixir of life which was given the princess to drink . she swallowed a little and was about to give the rest to the old man , but she was prevented from doing so . the robe of wings was about to be put upon her shoulders , but she said : " wait a little . i must not forget my good friend the emperor . i must write him once more to say good - by while still in this human form . "
in spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she wrote . she placed the phial of the elixir of life with the letter , and , giving them to the old man , she asked him to deliver them to the emperor . then the chariot began to roll heavenwards towards the moon , and as they all gazed with tearful eyes at the receding princess , the dawn broke , and in the rosy light of day the moon - chariot and all in it were lost amongst the fleecy clouds that were now wafted across the sky on the wings of the morning wind .
princess moonlight 's letter was carried to the palace . his majesty was afraid to touch the elixir of life , so he sent it with the letter to the top of the most sacred mountain in the land . mount fuji , and there the royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise . so to this day people say there is smoke to be seen rising from the top of mount fuji to the clouds .
