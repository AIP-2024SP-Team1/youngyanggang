once upon a time there was a proud prince who had a daughter . but the daughter was a child of ill luck . when it came time for her to marry , she had all her suitors assemble before her father 's palace . she was going to throw down a ball of red silk among them , and whoever caught it was to be her husband . now there were many princes and counts gathered before the castle , and in their midst there was also a beggar . and the princess could see dragons crawling into his ears and crawling out again from his nostrils , for he was a child of luck . so she threw the ball to the beggar and he caught it . her father asked angrily : " why did you throw the ball into the beggar 's hands ? "
" he is a favorite of fortune , " said the princess , " i will marry him , and then , perhaps , i will share in his good luck . " but her father would not hear of it , and since she insisted , he drove her from the castle in his rage . so the princess had to go off with the beggar . she dwelt with him in a little hut , and had to hunt for herbs and roots , and cook them herself , so that they might have something to eat ; and often they both went hungry .
one day her husband said to her : " i will set out and seek my fortune . and when i have found it , i will come back again and fetch you . " the princess was willing , and he went away , and was gone for eighteen years . meanwhile the princess lived in want and affliction , for her father remained hard and merciless . if her mother had not secretly given her food and money , no doubt she would have starved to death during all that time .
but the beggar found his fortune , and at length became emperor . he returned and stood before his wife . she however , no longer recognized him : she only knew that he was the powerful emperor . he asked her how she were getting along . " why do you ask me how i am getting along ? " she replied . " i am too far beneath your notice . "
" and who may your husband be ! " " my husband was a beggar . he went away to seek his fortune . that was eighteen years ago , and he has not yet returned . " " and what have you done during all those long years ? "
" i have been waiting for him to return . " " do you wish to marry some one else , seeing that he has been missing so long ? " " no , i will remain his wife until i die . "
when the emperor saw how faithful his wife was , he told her who he was , had her clothed in magnificent garments , and took her with him to his imperial palace . and there they lived in splendor and happiness . after a few days the emperor said to his wife : " we spend every day in festivities , as though every day were new year . "
" and why should we not celebrate , " answered his wife , " since we have now become emperor and empress ? " yet his wife was a child of ill luck . when she had been empress no more than eighteen days , she fell sick and died . but her husband lived for many a long year .
