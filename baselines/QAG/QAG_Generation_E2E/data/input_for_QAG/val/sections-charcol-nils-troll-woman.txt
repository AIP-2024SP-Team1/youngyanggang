in the old days there lived on a headland that juts out into the northwestern corner of lake rasval , in the neighborhood of the linde mining - district , a charcoal - burner named nils , generally known as charcoal nils . he let a farm - hand attend to his little plot of land , and he himself made his home in the forest , where he chopped wood in the summer and burned it to charcoal in the winter . yet no matter how hard he struggled , his work was unblessed with reward , and no one ever spoke of him save as poor charcoal nils .
one day , when he was on the opposite shore of the lake , near the gloomy harsberg , a strange woman came up to him , and asked whether he needed some one to help him with his charcoal burning .
" yes , indeed , " said he , " help would be welcome . " so she began to gather blocks of wood and tree - trunks , more than charcoal nils could have dragged together with his horse , and by noon there was enough wood for a new kiln . when evening came , she asked the charcoal - burner whether he were satisfied with the day 's work she had done , and if she were to come back the next day .
that suited the charcoal - burner perfectly , and she came back the next day and all the following ones . and when the kiln had been burned out she helped nils clear it , and never before had he had such a quantity of charcoal , nor charcoal of so fine a quality .
so she became his wife and lived with him in the wood for three years . they had three children , yet this worried nils but little , seeing that she looked after them , and they gave him no trouble .
but when the fourth year came , she grew more exacting , and insisted on going back to his home with him , and living with him there . nils wished to hear nothing about this ; yet since she was so useful to him in his charcoal - burning , he did not betray his feelings , and said he would think it over .
it happened one sunday that he went to church -- where he had not been for many years , and what he heard there brought up thoughts he had not known since the innocent days of his childhood . he began to wonder whether there were not some hocus - pocus about the charcoal - burning , and whether it were not due to the forest woman , who aided him so willingly .
preoccupied with this and other thoughts , he forgot while returning to his kiln , that he had promised the strange woman at the very beginning , when she had first helped him , that , whenever he had been home and was returning to the kiln , he would rap three times with his ax against an old pine - tree not far from it . on this occasion , as we have said , he forgot the sign , and as a result he saw something that nearly robbed him of his wits .
as he drew near the kiln , he saw it all aflame , and around it stood the three children and their mother , and they were clearing out the kiln . they were pulling down and putting out so that flames , smoke and ashes whirled sky - high , but instead of the spruce - branches that were generally used to put out the fire , they had bushy tails which they dipped in the snow !
when charcoal nils had looked on for a while , he slunk back to the old pine - tree , and made its trunk echo to the sound of his three ax - strokes till one could hear them on the harsberg . then he went to the kiln , as though he had seen nothing , and all went on as before . the kiln was glowing with a handsome , even glow , and the tall woman was about and working as usual .
as soon as she saw charcoal nils , she came back with her pressing demand that he take her home to his little house , and that they live there . " yes , that shall come about , " said nils to console her , and turned back home to fetch a horse . but instead he went out on the headline of kallernas , on the eastern shore of lake rasval , where a wise man lived , and asked the latter what he should do .
the old man advised him to go home and hitch his horse to his charcoal - wagon , but to hitch the horse in such wise that there would be not a single loop either in the harness or traces . then he was to mount the horse and ride back to the kiln without stopping , have the troll - woman and her children get into the wagon , and at once drive out on the ice with them .
the charcoal - burner did as the old man told him , saddled his horse , paying strict attention that there were no loops in saddle or bridle , rode across the ice through the wood to his kiln , and told the troll - woman and her children to get in . then he quickly turned back through the wood , out on the ice , and there let his horse run as fast as he could . when he reached the middle of the lake , he saw a pack of wolves running along in the direction of aboda - land , at the northern end of the lake , and heading for the ice . then he tore the saddle - harness from the traces , so that the wagon with the troll - folk was left standing on the bare ice , and rode as fast as his horse could carry him for the opposite shore . when the trolls saw the wolves they began to scream .
" turn back , turn back ! " cried the mother . " and if you will not for my sake , then at least do so for the sake of vipa ( peewee ) , your youngest daughter ! " but charcoal nils rode for the shore without looking back . then he heard the troll - woman calling on others for aid . " brother in the harsberg , sister in stripa , cousin in ringfels ; take the loop and pull ! "
" there is no loop to pull ! " came the answer from deep within the harsberg . " then catch him at harkallarn . " " he is not riding in that direction . " the reply came from ringfels . and indeed charcoal nils did not ride in that direction ; but over stick and stone straight to his own home . yet when he reached his own courtyard , the horse fell , and a shot from the trolls tore away a corner of the stable . nils shortly after fell sick , and had to lie a - bed for a number of weeks . when he was well again he sold his forest land , and worked the little farm by the cottage until his death . so that was one occasion when the troll - folk came off second best .
