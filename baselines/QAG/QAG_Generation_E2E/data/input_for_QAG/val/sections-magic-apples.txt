once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others . he was never short of money , for he had a purse which was never empty . he never was short of food , for he had a table - cloth on which , as soon as he spread it , he found all he wanted to eat and drink . and , besides , he had a magic wishing cap . when he put it on he could wish himself wherever he wanted , and there he would be that very moment . there was only one thing that he lacked : he had no wife , and he was gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to make haste .
as he was walking sadly along one fine day , it occurred to him to wish himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world . no sooner had he thought of it than he was there . and it was a land which he had never yet seen , and a city in which he had never yet been . and the king had a daughter , so handsome that he had never yet beheld her like , and he wanted to have her on the spot . but she would have nothing to do with him , and was very haughty .
finally he despaired altogether , and was so beside himself that he could no longer be where she was not . so he took his magic cap and wished himself into the castle . he wanted to say good - by , so he said . and she laid her hand in his . " i wish we were far beyond the end of the world ! " said the youth , and there they were . but the king 's daughter wept , and begged to be allowed to go home again . he could have all the gold and silver in the castle in return . " i have money enough for myself , " said the youth , and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about . he could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food , and drink the finest wines , said she . " i have enough to eat and drink myself , " said the youth . " see , you can sit down at the table , " said he , and at once he spread his table - cloth . and there stood a table covered with the best one might wish ; and the king himself ate no better .
after they had eaten , the king 's daughter said : " o , do look at the handsome apples up there on the tree ! if you were really kind , you would fetch me down a couple of them ! " the youth was not lazy , and climbed up . but he had forgotten his table - cloth and his purse , and these she took . and while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off . she at once put it on and wished herself back in her own room , and there she was that minute . " you might have known it , " said the youth to himself , and hurried down the tree . he began to cry and did not know what to do . and as he was sitting there , he sampled the apples which he had thrown down . no sooner had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head , and when he looked more closely , he had a pair of horns . " well , now it can do me no more harm , " said he , and calmly went on eating the apples . but suddenly the horns had disappeared , and he was as before . " good enough ! " said the youth . and with that he put the apples in his pocket , and set out to search for the king 's daughter .
he went from city to city , and sailed from country to country ; but it was a long journey , and lasted a year and a day , and even longer . but one day he got there after all . it was a sunday , and he found out that the king 's daughter was at church . then he sat himself down with his apples before the church door , and pretended to be a peddler . " apples of damascus ! apples of damascus ! " he cried . and sure enough , the king 's daughter came , and told her maidens to go and see what desirable things the peddler from abroad might have to offer . yes , he had apples of damascus . " what do the apples give one ? " asked the maiden . " wisdom and beauty ! " said the peddler , and the maiden bought .
when the king 's daughter had eaten of the apples , she had a pair of horns . and then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to hear . and the castle was hung with black , and in the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help the king 's daughter should get her , and half the kingdom besides . then tom , dick and harry , and the best physicians in the country came along . but none of them could help the princess . but one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court . he was not from their country , he said , and had made the journey purposely just to try his luck here . but he must see the king 's daughter alone , said he , and permission was granted him .
the king 's daughter recognized him , and grew red and pale in turn . " if i help you now , will you marry me ? " asked the youth . yes , indeed she would . then he gave her one of the magic apples , and her horns were only half as large as before . " but i can not do more until i have my cap , and my table - cloth , and my purse back again , " said he . so she went and brought him the things . then he gave her still another magic apple , and now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets . " but now i can not go on until you have sworn that you will be true to me , " said he . and she swore that she would . and after she had eaten the third apple , her forehead was quite smooth again , and she was even more beautiful than in days gone by .
then there was great joy in the castle . they prepared for the wedding with baking and brewing , and invited people from east and west to come to it . and they ate and drank , and were merry and of good cheer , and if they have not stopped , they are merry and of good cheer to this very day !
