once upon a time there was a sinister old couple , who lived out under the open sky . all that they had were three sons , an old cook - pot , an old frying - pan , and an old cat . then the man died , and after a time his wife died , too . now their estate was to be divided . so the oldest took the old cook - pot , and the second took the old frying - pan , and ebe ashpeter had no choice . he had to take the old cat , and they did not ask him whether he wanted to or not .
" brother peter can scrape out the cook - pot after he has loaned it out , " said ebe . " brother paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying - pan ; but what am i to do with this wretched cat ? " and he was angry and envious . yet he scratched the cat and stroked it , and this pleased the cat so that she began to purr , and raised her tail in the air . " wait , wait , i 'll help you yet , " said the cat , " wait , wait , i 'll help you yet ! "
there was nothing to bite or break in the hut . brother peter and brother paul had each of them gone off in a different direction . so ebe set out , too , with the cat in the lead , himself following ; but after a time he turned and went home again , to see whether the floor had been swept , and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a great rock , and there she met an enormous herd of reindeer . the cat crept softly around the herd , and then with one leap sprang between the horns of the finest buck .
" if you do not go where i want you to , i 'll scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said she . so the buck did not dare do anything save what the cat wished , and off they went over stick and stone , from cliff to cliff , close by ebe , who was just polishing the door - sill of his house , and with one bound right into the castle . " i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might care to have this buck reindeer to drive , " said the cat . yes , he could make good use of such a young , handsome animal , some time , when he had occasion to drive out to visit a neighboring king . " this ebe must be a proud and powerful lord , " said the king , " if he can make me such presents . " " yes , he is the greatest lord in all your land and kingdom , " said the cat , but no matter how many questions the king asked , he learned nothing more .
" tell him that i am much obliged , " said the king , and he sent him a whole cart - load of handsome presents . but ebe looked past them and paid no attention to them . " brother peter can scrape out his cook - pot when he has loaned it out , and brother paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying - pan ; but what am i to do with this wretched cat ! " said he , and felt angry and envious ; but still he scratched the cat , and stroked her , and this pleased her so much that she began to purr , and raised her tail in the air . " wait , wait , i will help you yet , " said the cat , " wait , wait , i will help you yet ! "
the next day they both set out again , the cat in the lead , and ebe following . after a while he turned back to see whether the folding - table at home had been scoured . and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a dense forest slope . there she found an enormous herd of elk . the cat crept softly up , and suddenly there she sat between the horns of one of the stateliest of the bull elks . " if you do not go where i want you to , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat . the elk did not dare do anything save what the cat wished , and so off they went , like lightning , over stick and stone , from cliff to cliff , right past ebe , who stood before the house scouring the shutters , and with one bound into the king 's castle .
" i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bull elk for courier service . " it was quite clear that should the king want a swift messenger , some time , he could not find a swifter in all his kingdom . " this ebe must be a most distinguished lord , since he finds such presents for me , " said the king . " yes , indeed , one might call him a distinguished lord , " said the cat , " his wealth is without end or limit . " but no matter how many other questions the king asked , he received no more explicit information . " tell him that i am much obliged , and to do me the honor to call when he is passing here some time , " said the king , and sent him a robe as handsome as the one he himself was wearing , and three cartloads of handsome presents . but ebe did not even want to put on the royal robe , and hardly looked at the other presents .
" brother peter can scrape out his cook - pot when he has loaned it out , brother paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying - pan ; but of what use is this wretched cat to me ! " he said , in spite of all . yet he stroked the cat , and pressed her to his cheek , and scratched her , and this pleased the cat so very much that she purred more than on the other occasions , and stuck her tail up into the air as straight as a rod . " wait , wait , i will help you yet , " said the cat , " wait , wait , i will help you yet ! "
on the third day they set out again , the cat in the lead , and ebe following . after a time it occurred to him to go back and let the mice out of the house , so that they would not be altogether starved in the old hut ; and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a dense pine forest , and there she met a father bear , a mother bear and a baby bear . the cat crept softly up to them , and all at once she was hanging by her claws to the father bear 's head .
" if you do not go where i want you to , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat , and spit and arched her back . then the father bear did not dare do anything save what the cat wished , and now they dashed past ebe , who had just carried all the young mice over the threshold , like a storm , over stick and stone , from cliff to cliff , so that the earth trembled and shook . the king was just standing in the hallway , and was not a little surprised to see such guests arriving .
" i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bear for a general or royal counselor , " said the cat . the king was more than pleased to secure such a creature for his nearest adviser , who could doubt it . " tell him that i am much obliged , but that i do not at all know how to show my appreciation , " said the king . " well , he would like to marry your youngest daughter ! " said the cat . " yes , but that is asking a good deal , " said the king . " he really ought to pay me a visit . " " ebe does not enter such plain houses , " said the cat . " has he a handsomer castle than this ? " asked the king . " handsomer ? why , your castle seems like the shabbiest hut in comparison with his ! " was the cat 's reply .
" you dare come into my presence , and tell me that there is some one living in my kingdom who is more handsomely housed than i , the king ! " shouted the king , beside himself with rage . he came near wringing the cat 's neck . " you might wait until you see it , " said the cat . and the king said yes , he would wait . " but if you have told me a falsehood , you shall die , and though you had seven lives , " said he . in the morning the king and the whole court set out to travel to ebe ashpeter 's castle . the cat was in the little hut , and called for ebe , thinking it would be best if both of them got underway an hour earlier . after they had gone a while , they met some folk who were herding sheep ; and the sheep were bleating and grazing over the whole plain . they were as large as full - grown calves , and their wool was so long that it dragged along the ground after them . " to whom do the sheep belong ? " asked the cat . " to helge - hal in the blue hill , " said the shepherds .
" the court is coming past in a moment , " said the cat , " and if then you do not at once say that they belong to ebe , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat , and spat and arched her back , and showed her teeth . then the shepherds were so frightened that they at once promised to do as the cat had ordered . " but to whom do all these sheep belong ? " asked the king , when he came by with the court somewhat later . " they are every bit as handsome as my own ! " " they belong to ebe , " said the shepherds .
then the cat and ebe wandered on for a while , and came to a dense forest slope . there they met folk who were tending goats . the goats skipped and leaped about everywhere , and gave such fine milk that better could no where be found . " to whom do the goats belong ? " asked the cat . " to helge - hal in the blue hill , " said the herdsmen . then the cat again went through her ferocious preparations , and the herdsmen were so frightened that they did not dare oppose her wishes . " now who in the world can be the owner of so many goats ? " asked the king . " i myself have none finer ! " " they belong to ebe , " said the herdsmen .
then they wandered on for a while , and met folk who were tending cows : wherever one looked the cows lowed and glistened , and each yielded milk enough for three . when the cat heard that these herdsmen were also in the service of helge - hal of the blue hill , she spat once more , and arched her back , and then all the herdsmen were ready that moment to say what she wished . " but in heaven 's name , to whom do all these beautiful cattle belong ? " asked the king . " there are no such cattle in my whole kingdom ! " " they belong to lord ebe , " said the herdsmen .
then they wandered on for a long , long time . at last they came to a great plain , and there they met horse - herders ; and horses whinnied and disported themselves over the whole plain , and their coats were so fine that they glistened as though gilded , and each horse was worth a whole castle . " for whom do you herd these horses ? " asked the cat . " for helge - hal in the blue hill , " the herders replied . " well , the court will come by here in a little while , " said the cat , " and if you do not say you are herding them for ebe , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat , and she spat , and showed her teeth and claws , and grew so angry her hair stood up all along her back . then the herders were terribly frightened , and did not dare do anything but what the cat wished .
" but in the name of heaven , to whom do all these horses belong ? " asked the king , when he came by with his court . " they belong to ebe , " said the herders . " i never have seen or heard anything like it in all my life ! " cried the king . " this ebe is such a distinguished lord that it is past my understanding ! "
the cat and ebe had long since gone on their way , and had wandered far and ever farther over hill and rock . in the evening , at dusk , they came to a royal castle that glittered and shimmered as though it were of the purest silver and gold - which it was . yet it was gloomy and depressing , and lonely and barren there , and nowhere was there a sign of life .
here they went in , and the cat stood with a cake of rye meal just below the door . suddenly there came a thundering and a thumping so that the earth trembled , and the whole castle shook , and that was the troll who was coming home . and suddenly all was quiet again , and before they knew it , helge - hal in the blue hill had thrust his three great horrible heads in at the door .
" let me in ! let me in ! " he cried , so that every one shivered . " wait , wait a bit while i tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake , " said the cat , and spoke to him in the sweetest way . " first he was threshed , and then he was beaten , and then he was pounded , and then he was thumped , and then he was thrown from one wall to another , and then he was sifted through a sieve .... "
" let me in ! let me in , you chatterbox ! " cried the troll , and he was so furious that the sparks flew from him . " wait a bit , wait a bit . i will tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake ! " said the cat , and he spoke to him still more sweetly .
" first he was threshed , and then he was beaten , and then he was pounded , and then he was thumped , and then he was thrown from one wall to another , and then he was sifted through a sieve , and shaken here and there , and then he was put on the drying - board , and then in the stove , until it grew so hot that he puffed up more and more , and wanted to get out , but could not , " said the cat , and took her time .
" get out of the way and let me in ! " cried the troll once more , and nearly burst with rage ; but the cat acted as though she did not hear him , and talked down the blue from the sky , and went up and down the while , and whenever the troll tried to come in , she met him beneath the door with the cake . " o , but do take a look at the shining maiden coming up there behind the mountain ! " said the cat , after she had talked at length about the sufferings of the rye . and helge - hal in the blue hill turned his three heads around in order to see the beautiful maiden , too . then the sun rose , and the troll stiffened into stone . now ebe obtained all the riches that the troll had possessed , the sheep and goats , the cows and all the spirited horses , and the handsome golden castle , and some big bags of money besides .
" here come the king and all his court , " said the cat . " just go out before the door and receive them ! " so ebe got up and went to meet them . " you are indeed a very distinguished lord ! " said the king to him . " so far as i am concerned you may have the youngest princess ! "
then they started brewing and baking on a large scale in the greatest haste , and everything was made ready for the wedding . on the first day of the feast the cat came and begged the bridegroom to cut off her head . this he did not at all want to do ; but the cat spat and showed her teeth , and then ebe did not dare disobey her . but when the head fell to the ground , the cat turned into a most handsome prince . he married the second princess , and as the wedding procession was on its way to church , they met a third prince who was looking for a wife , and he took the oldest princess . then they all three celebrated their weddings so that the story went the rounds in twelve kingdoms . " spin , span , spun , now our tale is done ! "
