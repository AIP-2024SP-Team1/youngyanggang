the wild people who dwell in the south - west are masters of many black arts . they often lure men of the middle kingdom to their country by promising them their daughters in marriage , but their promises are not to be trusted . once there was the son of a poor family , who agreed to labor for three years for one of the wild men in order to become his son - in - law .
at the end of that time the wedding was celebrated , and the couple were given a little house for a home . but no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard , since her parents did not like him , and would seek to do him harm . in accordance with the custom she entered the house first with a lighted lantern , but when the bridegroom followed her she had disappeared . and thus it went , day by day . during the daytime she was there , but when evening came she disappeared .
and one day , not long after they had been married , his wife said to him : " to - morrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday , and you must go to congratulate her . they will offer you tea and food . the tea you may drink , but be sure not to touch any of the food . keep this in mind ! " so the following day the wife and husband went to her mother 's home and offered their congratulations . her parents seemed highly pleased , and served them with tea and sweets . the son - in - law drank , but ate nothing , though his wife 's parents , with kind words and friendly gestures , kept urging him to help himself . at last the son - in - law did not know what to do , and thought that surely they could mean him no ill . and seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him , he ate a little of them . his wife gave him a reproachful glance , and he offered some excuse for taking his leave .
but his mother - in - law said : " this is my birthday . you simply must taste my birthday noodles ! " with that she placed a great dish before him , filled with noodles that looked like threads of silver , mingled with fat meat , and spiced with fragrant mushrooms . during all the time he had been living in the country the son - in - law had never yet seen such an appetizing dish . its pleasant odor rose temptingly to his nostrils , and he could not resist raising his chop - sticks . his wife glanced over at him , but he pretended that he did not see her . she coughed significantly , but he acted as though he did not hear . finally she trod on his foot under the table ; and then he regained control of himself .
he had not as yet eaten half of the food and said : " my hunger is satisfied . " then he took leave , and went off with his wife . " this is a serious matter , " said the latter . " you would not listen to my words , and now you will surely have to die ! "
but still he did not believe her , until he suddenly felt terrible pains , which soon grew unbearable , so that he fell to the ground unconscious . his wife at once hung him up by the feet from the beam of the roof , and put a panful of glowing charcoal under his body , and a great jar of water , into which she had poured sesame oil , in front of the fire , directly below his mouth . and when the fire had heated him thoroughly , he suddenly opened his mouth - and can you imagine what came out of it ? a squirming , crawling mass of poisonous worms , centipedes , toads and tadpoles , who all fell into the jar of water . then his wife untied him , carried him to bed , and gave him wine mingled with realgar to drink . then he recovered .
" what you ate in the belief that they were eels and crabs , " said his wife , " were nothing but toads and tadpoles , and the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes . but you must continue to be careful . my parents know that you have not died , and they will think up other evil plans . " a few days later his father - in - law said to him : " there is a large tree growing on the precipice which juts over the cave . in it is the nest of the phenix . you are still young and able to climb , so go there quickly and fetch me the eggs ! " his son - in - law went home and told his wife .
" take long bamboo poles , " said she , " and tie them together , and fasten a curved sword at the top . and take these nine loaves of bread and these hens ' eggs , there are seven times seven of them . carry them along with you in a basket . when you come to the spot you will see a large nest up in the branches . do not climb the tree , but chop it down with the curved sword . then throw away your poles , and run for dear life . should a monster appear and follow you , throw him the loaves of bread , three loaves at a time , and finally throw down the eggs on the ground and make for home as quickly as you can . in this way you may escape the danger which threatens you . "
the man noted all she said exactly and went . and sure enough he saw the bird 's nest - it was as large as a round pavilion . then he tied his curved sword to the poles , chopped at the tree with all his strength , laid down his poles on the ground and never looked around but ran for dear life . suddenly he heard the roaring of a thunder - storm rising above him . when he looked up he saw a great dragon , many fathoms long and some ten feet across . his eyes gleamed like two lamps and he was spitting fire and flame from his maw . he had stretched out two feelers and was feeling along the ground . then the man swiftly flung the loaves into the air .
the dragon caught them , and it took a little time before he had devoured them . but no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon once more came flying after him . then he flung him more loaves and when the loaves came to an end , he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled over the ground . the dragon had not yet satisfied his hunger and opened his greedy jaws wide . when he suddenly caught sight of the eggs , he descended from the air , and since the eggs were scattered round about , it took some time before he had sucked them all . in the meantime the man succeeded in escaping to his home .
when he entered the door and saw his wife , he said to her , amid sobs : " it was all i could do to escape , and i am lucky not to be in the dragon 's stomach ! if this sort of thing keeps up much longer i am bound to die ! " with these words he kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life . " where is your home ? " asked his wife .
" my home is about a hundred miles away from here , in the middle kingdom , and my old mother is still living . the only thing that worries me is that we are so poor . " his wife said : " i will flee with you , and we will find your mother . and waste no regrets on your poverty . " with that she gathered up all the house held in the way of pearls and precious stones , put them in a bag and had her husband tie it around his waist . then she also gave him an umbrella , and in the middle of the night they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder , and stole away .
his wife had also said to him : " take the umbrella on your back and run as fast as ever you can ! do not open it , and do not look around ! i will follow you in secret . " so he turned north and ran with all his might and main . he had been running for a day and a night , had covered nearly a hundred miles , and passed the boundaries of the wild people 's country , when his legs gave out and he grew hungry . before him lay a mountain village . he stopped at the village gate to rest , drew some food from his pocket and began to eat . and he looked around without being able to see his wife . said he to himself : " perhaps she has deceived me after all , and is not coming with me ! "
after he had finished eating , he took a drink from a spring , and painfully dragged himself further . when the heat of the day was greatest a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall . in his haste he forgot what his wife had told him and opened his umbrella . and out fell his wife upon the ground . she reproached him : " once more you have not listened to my advice . now the damage has been done ! " quickly she told him to go to the village , and there to buy a white cock , seven black tea - cups , and half a length of red nettlecloth .
" do not be sparing of the silver pieces in your pocket ! " she cried after him as he went off . he went to the village , attended to everything , and came back . the woman tore the cloth apart , made a coat of it and put it on . no sooner had they walked a few miles before they could see a red cloud rising up in the south , like a flying bird . " that is my mother , " said the woman .
in a moment the cloud was overhead . then the woman took the black tea - cups and threw them at it . seven she threw and seven fell to earth again . and then they could hear the mother in the cloud weeping and scolding , and thereupon the cloud disappeared . they went on for about four hours . then they heard a sound like the noise of silk being torn , and could see a cloud as black as ink , which was rushing up against the wind . " alas , that is my father ! " said the woman . " this is a matter of life and death , for he will not let us be ! because of my love for you i will now have to disobey the holiest of laws ! "
with these words she quickly seized the white cock , separated its head from its body , and flung the head into the air . at once the black cloud dissolved , and her father 's body , the head severed from the trunk , fell down by the edge of the road . then the woman wept bitterly , and when she had wept her fill they buried the corpse . thereupon they went together to her husband 's home , where they found his old mother still living . they then undid the bag of pearls and jewels , bought a piece of good ground , built a fine house , and became wealthy and respected members of the community .
