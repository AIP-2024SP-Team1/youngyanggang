in the days of the emperor yau lived a prince by the name of hou i , who was a mighty hero and a good archer . once ten suns rose together in the sky , and shone so brightly and burned so fiercely that the people on earth could not endure them . so the emperor ordered hou i to shoot at them . and hou i shot nine of them down from the sky . besides his bow , hou i also had a horse which ran so swiftly that even the wind could not catch up with it .
he mounted it to go a - hunting , and the horse ran away and could not be stopped . so hou i came to kunlun mountain and met the queen - mother of the jasper sea . and she gave him the herb of immortality . he took it home with him and hid it in his room . but his wife who was named tschang o , once ate some of it on the sly when he was not at home , and she immediately floated up to the clouds . when she reached the moon , she ran into the castle there , and has lived there ever since as the lady of the moon .
on a night in mid - autumn , an emperor of the tang dynasty once sat at wine with two sorcerers . and one of them took his bamboo staff and cast it into the air , where it turned into a heavenly bridge , on which the three climbed up to the moon together . there they saw a great castle on which was inscribed : " the spreading halls of crystal cold . " beside it stood a cassia tree which blossomed and gave forth a fragrance filling all the air . and in the tree sat a man who was chopping off the smaller boughs with an ax .
one of the sorcerers said : " that is the man in the moon . the cassia tree grows so luxuriantly that in the course of time it would overshadow all the moon 's radiance . therefore it has to be cut down once in every thousand years . " then they entered the spreading halls . the silver stories of the castle towered one above the other , and its walls and columns were all formed of liquid crystal . in the walls were cages and ponds , where fishes and birds moved as though alive . the whole moon - world seemed made of glass . while they were still looking about them on all sides the lady of the moon stepped up to them , clad in a white mantle and a rainbow - colored gown .
she smiled and said to the emperor : " you are a prince of the mundane world of dust . great is your fortune , since you have been able to find your way here ! " and she called for her attendants , who came flying up on white birds , and sang and danced beneath the cassia tree . a pure clear music floated through the air . beside the tree stood a mortar made of white marble , in which a jasper rabbit ground up herbs . that was the dark half of the moon . when the dance had ended , the emperor returned to earth again with the sorcerers . and he had the songs which he had heard on the moon written down and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in his pear - tree garden .
