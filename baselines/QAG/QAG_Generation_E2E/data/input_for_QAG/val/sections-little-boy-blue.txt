there once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers . her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley , upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills ; and although poor , she was contented with her lot , for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her . he had big blue eyes , and fair golden curls , and he loved his good mother very dearly , and was never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work .
and so the years passed happily away till the boy was eight years old , but then the widow fell sick , and their little store of money melted gradually away . " i do n't know what we shall do for bread , " she said , kissing her boy with tears in her eyes , " for i am not yet strong enough to work , and we have no money left . " " but i can work , " answered the boy ; " and i 'm sure if i go to the squire up at the hall he will give me something to do . " at first the widow was reluctant to consent to this , since she loved to keep her child at her side , but finally , as nothing else could be done , she decided to let him go to see the squire .
being too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes , she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times , and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it , he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale . for the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage , and the color just matched the blue of his eyes . his trousers were blue , also , and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his , that he might appear the finer . and then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the squire .
it so happened that the great man was walking in his garden with his daughter madge that morning , and was feeling in an especially happy mood , so that when he suddenly looked up and saw a little boy before him , he said , kindly , " well , my child , what can i do for you ? " " if you please , sir , " said the boy , bravely , although he was frightened at meeting the squire face to face , " i want you to give me some work to do , so that i can earn money . " " earn money ! " repeated the squire , " why do you wish to earn money ? " " to buy food for my mother , sir . we are very poor , and since she is no longer able to work for me i wish to work for her . " " but what can you do ? " asked the squire ; " you are too small to work in the fields . " " i could earn something , sir , could n't i ? "
his tone was so pleading that mistress madge was unable to resist it , and even the squire was touched . the young lady came forward and took the boy 's hand in her own , and pressing back his curls , she kissed his fair cheek . " you shall be our shepherd , " she said , pleasantly , " and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting into the corn . you know , father , " she continued , turning to the squire , " it was only yesterday you said you must get a boy to tend the sheep , and this little boy can do it nicely . " " very well , " replied the squire , " it shall be as you say , and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money . " then he turned to the child and said , " come to me in the morning , my little man , and i will give you a silver horn to blow , that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray . what is your name ? "
" oh , never mind his name , papa ! " broke in the squire 's daughter ; " i shall call him little boy blue , since he is dressed in blue from head to foot , and his dress but matches his eyes . and you must give him a good wage , also , for surely no squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this . " " very good , " said the squire , cheerfully , as he pinched his daughter 's rosy cheek ; " be watchful , little boy blue , and you shall be well paid . " then little boy blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the river - side , to tell the good news to his mother .
the poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story , and smiled when he told her that his name was to be little boy blue . she knew the squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son . early the next morning little boy blue was at the hall , and the squire 's steward gave him a new silver horn , that glistened brightly in the sunshine , and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck . and then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows , and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain . it was not hard work , but just suited to little boy blue 's age , and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed . his mother needed food no longer , for the squire paid her son liberally and the squire 's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills . even the sheep and the cows were fond of him , and always obeyed the sound of his horn ; therefore the squire 's corn thrived finely , and was never trampled .
little boy blue was now very happy , and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health . after a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day ; but she could not go far , because her limbs were too feeble to support her long , so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet little boy blue as he came home from work in the evening . then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him , and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps . but one day a great misfortune came upon them , since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it .
little boy blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked , for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage . but when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight , and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears . little boy blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother , her face white and drawn with suffering , and tears of anguish running down her cheeks . for she had slipped upon the stile and fallen , and her leg was broken !
little boy blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman 's face , and raised her head that she might drink . there were no neighbors , for the cottage stood all alone by the river , so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage . fortunately , it was not far , and at last she was safely laid upon her bed . then little boy blue began to think what he should do next . " can i leave you alone while i go for the doctor , mamma ? " he asked , anxiously , as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones . his mother drew him towards her and kissed him .
" take the boat , dear , " she said , " and fetch the doctor from the village . i shall be patient till you return . " little boy blue rushed away to the river bank and unfastened the little boat ; and then he pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below . when he had found the doctor and told of his mother 's misfortune , the good man promised to attend him at once , and very soon they were seated in the boat and on their way to the cottage .
it was very dark by this time , but little boy blue knew every turn and bend in the river , and the doctor helped him pull at the oars , so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window . they found the poor woman in much pain , but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg , and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering . it was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village . " take good care of your mother , " he said to the boy , " and do n't worry about her , for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time ; but she will be in bed many days , and you must nurse her as well as you are able . "
all through the night the boy sat by the bedside , bathing his mother 's fevered brow and ministering to her wants . and when the day broke she was resting easily and the pain had left her , and she told little boy blue he must go to his work . " for , " said she , " more than ever now we need the money you earn from the squire , as my misfortune will add to the expenses of living , and we have the doctor to pay . do not fear to leave me , for i shall rest quietly and sleep most of the time while you are away . "
little boy blue did not like to leave his mother all alone , but he knew of no one he could ask to stay with her ; so he placed food and water by her bedside , and ate a little breakfast himself , and started off to tend his sheep . the sun was shining brightly , and the birds sang sweetly in the trees , and the crickets chirped just as[38 ] merrily as if this great trouble had not come to little boy blue to make him sad . but he went bravely to his work , and for several hours he watched carefully ; and the men at work in the fields , and the squire 's daughter , who sat embroidering upon the porch of the great house , heard often the sound of his horn as he called the straying sheep to his side .
but he had not slept the whole night , and he was tired with his long watch at his mother 's bedside , and so in spite of himself the lashes would droop occasionally over his blue eyes , for he was only a child , and children feel the loss of sleep more than older people . still , little boy blue had no intention of sleeping while he was on duty , and bravely fought against the drowsiness that was creeping over him . the sun shone very hot that day , and he walked to the shady side of a big haystack and sat down upon the ground , leaning his back against the stack .
the cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him , and he watched them earnestly for a time , listening to the singing of the birds , and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers , and the far - away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears . and before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast , and the golden head lay back upon the hay , and little boy blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him . the sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused , waiting for the warning sound of the horn . and the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast . but the silver horn was silent , and before long the cows were feeding upon the squire 's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows .
the squire himself was returning from a long , weary ride over his farms , and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry . " little boy blue ! " he cried ; " ho ! little boy blue , come blow your horn ! " but there was no reply . he rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows , and that made him more angry still . " here , isaac , " he said to a farmer 's lad who chanced to pass by , " where is little boy blue ? " " he 's under the hay - stack , your honor , fast asleep ! " replied isaac with a grin , for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep . " will you go and wake him ? " asked the squire ; " for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage . "
" not i , " replied isaac , " if i wake him he 'll surely cry , for he is but a baby , and not fit to mind the sheep . but i myself will drive them out for your honor , " and away he ran to do so , thinking that now the squire would give him little boy blue 's place , and make him the shepherd boy , for isaac had long coveted the position . the squire 's daughter , hearing the angry tones of her father 's voice , now came out to see what was amiss , and when she heard that little boy blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved , for she had loved the child for his pretty ways . the squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying . " awake ! " said he , shaking him by the shoulder , " and depart from my lands , for you have betrayed my trust , and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows ! "
little boy blue started up at once and rubbed his eyes ; and then he did as isaac prophesied , and began to weep bitterly , for his heart was sore that he had failed in his duty to the good squire and so forfeited his confidence . but the squire 's daughter was moved by the child 's tears , so she took him upon her lap and comforted him , asking , " why did you sleep , little boy blue , when you should have watched the cows and the sheep ? " " my mother has broken her leg , " answered the boy , between his sobs , " and i did not sleep all last night , but sat by her bedside nursing her . and i tried hard not to fall asleep , but could not help myself;[41 ] and oh , squire ! i hope you will forgive me this once , for my poor mother 's sake ! " " where does your mother live ? " asked the squire , in a kindly tone , for he had already forgiven little boy blue .
" in the cottage down by the river , " answered the child ; " and she is all alone , for there is no one near to help us in our trouble . " " come , " said mistress madge , rising to her feet and taking his hand ; " lead us to your home , and we will see if we can not assist your poor mother . " so the squire and his daughter and little boy blue all walked down to the little cottage , and the squire had a long talk with the poor widow . and that same day a big basket of dainties was sent to the cottage , and mistress madge bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered .
so that after all little boy blue did more for his dear mother by falling asleep than he could had he kept wide awake ; for after his mother was well again the squire gave them a pretty cottage to live in very near to the great house itself , and the squire 's daughter was ever afterward their good friend , and saw that they wanted for no comforts of life . and little boy blue did not fall asleep again at his post , but watched the cows and the sheep faithfully for many years , until he grew up to manhood and had a farm of his own . he always said his mother 's accident had brought him good luck , but i think it was rather his own loving heart and his devotion to his mother that made him friends . for no one is afraid to trust a boy who loves to serve and care for his mother .
