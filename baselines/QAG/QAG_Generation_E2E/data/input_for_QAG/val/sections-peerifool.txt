there was once a king and a queen in rousay who had three daughters . when the young princesses were just grown up , the king died , and the crown passed to a distant cousin , who had always hated him , and who paid no heed to the widowed queen and her daughters . so they were left very badly off , and they went to live in a tiny cottage , and did all the housework themselves . they had a kailyard in front of the cottage , and a little field behind it , and they had a cow that grazed in the field , and which they fed with the cabbages that grew in the kailyard . for everyone knows that to feed cows with cabbages makes them give a larger quantity of milk . but they soon discovered that some one was coming at night and stealing the cabbages , and , of course , this annoyed them very much . for they knew that if they had not cabbages to give to the cow , they would not have enough milk to sell .
so the eldest princess said she would take out a three - legged stool , and wrap herself in a blanket , and sit in the kailyard all night to see if she could catch the thief . and , although it was very cold and very dark , she did so . at first it seemed as if all her trouble would be in vain , for hour after hour passed and nothing happened . but in the small hours of the morning , just as the clock was striking two , she heard a stealthy trampling in the field behind , as if some very heavy person were trying to tread very softly , and presently a mighty giant stepped right over the wall into the kailyard . he carried an enormous creel on his arm , and a large , sharp knife in his hand ; and he began to cut the cabbages , and to throw them into the creel as fast as he could .
now the princess was no coward , so , although she had not expected to face a giant , she gathered up her courage , and cried out sharply , " who gave thee liberty to cut our cabbages ? leave off this minute , and go away . " the giant paid no heed , but went on steadily with what he was doing . " do you not hear me ? " cried the girl indignantly ; for she was the princess royal , and had always been accustomed to be obeyed . " if you will be not quiet i will take you too , " said the giant grimly , pressing the cabbages down into the creel . " i should like to see you try , " retorted the princess , rising from her stool and stamping her foot ; for she felt so angry that she forgot for a moment that she was only a weak maiden and he was a great and powerful giant .
and , as if to show her how strong he was , he seized her by her arm and her leg , and put her in his creel on the top of the cabbages , and carried her away bodily . when he reached his home , which was in a great square house on a lonely moor , he took her out , and set her down roughly on the floor . " you will be my servant now , " he said , " and keep my house , and do my errands for me . i have a cow , which you must drive out every day to the hillside ; and see , here is a bag of wool , when you have taken out the cow , you must come back and settle thyself at home , as a good housewife should , and comb , and card it , and spin it into yarn , with which to weave a good thick cloth for my raiment . i am out most of the day , but when i come home i shall expect to find all this done , and a great bicker of porridge boiled besides for my supper . "
the poor princess was very dismayed when she heard these words , for she had never been accustomed to work hard , and she had always had her sisters to help her ; but the giant took no notice of her distress , but went out as soon as it was daylight , leaving her alone in the house to begin her work . as soon as he had gone she drove the cow to the pasture , as he had told her to do ; but she had a good long walk over the moor before she reached the hill , and by the time that she got back to the house she felt very tired . so she thought that she would put on the porridge pot , and make herself some porridge before she began to card and comb the wool . she did so , and just as she was sitting down to sup them the door opened , and a crowd of wee , wee peerie folk came in .
they were the tiniest men and women that the princess had ever seen ; not one of them would have reached half - way to her knee ; and they were dressed in dresses fashioned out of all the colours of the rainbow -- scarlet and blue , green and yellow , orange and violet ; and the funny thing was , that every one of them had a shock of straw - coloured yellow hair . they were all talking and laughing with one another ; and they hopped up , first on stools , then on chairs , till at last they reached the top of the table , where they clustered round the bowl , out of which the princess was eating her porridge . " we be hungry , we be hungry , " they cried , in their tiny shrill voices . " spare a little porridge for the peerie folk . "
but the princess was hungry also ; and , besides being hungry , she was both tired and cross ; so she shook her head and waved them impatiently away with her spoon , " little for one , and less for two , and never a grain have i for you . " she said sharply , and , to her great delight , for she did not feel quite comfortable with all the peerie folk standing on the table looking at her , they vanished in a moment .
after this she finished her porridge in peace ; then she took the wool out of the bag , and she set to work to comb and card it . but it seemed as if it were bewitched ; it curled and twisted and coiled itself round her fingers so that , try as she would , she could not do anything with it . and when the giant came home he found her sitting in despair with it all in confusion round her , and the porridge , which she had left for him in the pot , burned to a cinder . as you may imagine , he was very angry , and raged , and stamped , and used the most dreadful words ; and at last he took her by the heels , and beat her until all her back was skinned and bleeding ; then he carried her out to the byre , and threw her up on the joists among the hens . and , although she was not dead , she was so stunned and bruised that she could only lie there motionless , looking down on the backs of the cows . time went on , and in the kailyard at home the cabbages were disappearing as fast as ever . so the second princess said that she would do as her sister had done , and wrap herself in a blanket , and go and sit on a three - legged stool all night , to see what was becoming of them .
she did so , and exactly the same fate befell her that had befallen her elder sister . the giant appeared with his creel , and he carried her off , and set her to mind the cow and the house , and to make his porridge and to spin ; and the little yellow - headed peerie folk appeared and asked her for some supper , and she refused to give it to them ; and after that , she could not comb or card her wool , and the giant was angry , and he scolded her , and beat her , and threw her up , half dead , on the joists beside her sister and the hens . then the youngest princess determined to sit out in the kailyard all night , not so much to see what was becoming of the cabbages , as to discover what had happened to her sisters . and when the giant came and carried her off , she was not at all sorry , but very glad , for she was a brave and loving little maiden ; and now she felt that she had a chance of finding out where they were , and whether they were dead or alive .
so she was quite cheerful and happy , for she felt certain that she was clever enough to outwit the giant , if only she were watchful and patient ; so she lay quite quietly in her creel above the cabbages , but she kept her eyes very wide open to see by which road he was carrying her off . and when he set her down in his kitchen , and told her all that he expected her to do , she did not look downcast like her sisters , but nodded her head brightly , and said that she felt sure that she could do it . and she sang to herself as she drove the cow over the moor to pasture , and she ran the whole way back , so that she should have a good long afternoon to work at the wool , and , although she would not have told the giant this , to search the house .
before she set to work , however , she made herself some porridge , just as her sisters had done ; and , just as she was going to sup them , all the little yellow - haired peerie folk trooped in , and climbed up on the table , and stood and stared at her . " we be hungry , we be hungry , " they cried . " spare a little porridge for the peerie folk . " " with all my heart , " replied the good - natured princess . " if you can find dishes little enough for you to sup out of , i will fill them for you . but , it seems to me , if i were to give you all porringers , you would smother yourselves among the porridge . "
at her words the peerie folk shouted with laughter , till their straw - coloured hair tumbled right over their faces ; then they hopped on to the floor and ran out of the house , and presently they came trooping back holding cups of blue - bells , and foxgloves , and saucers of primroses and anemones in their hands ; and the princess put a tiny spoonful of porridge into each saucer , and a tiny drop of milk into each cup , and they ate it all up as daintily as possible with neat little grass spoons , which they had brought with them in their pockets . when they had finished they all cried out , " thank you ! thank you ! " and ran out of the kitchen again , leaving the princess alone . and , being alone , she went all over the house to look for her sisters , but , of course , she could not find them . " never mind , i will find them soon , " she said to herself . " to - morrow i will search the byre and the outhouses ; in the meantime , i had better get on with my work . " so she went back to the kitchen , and took out the bag of wool , which the giant had told her to make into cloth .
but just as she was doing so the door opened once more , and a yellow - haired peerie boy entered . he was exactly like the other peerie folk who had eaten the princess 's porridge , only he was bigger , and he wore a very rich dress of grass - green velvet . he walked boldly into the middle of the kitchen and looked round him . " do you have any work for me to do ? " he asked . " i know grand how to handle wool and turn it into fine thick cloth . " " i have plenty of work for anybody who asks it , " replied the princess ; " but i have no money to pay for it , and there are but few folk in this world who will work without wages . " " all the wages that i ask is that tyou will take the trouble to find out my name , for few folk ken it , and few folk care to know . but if by any chance you can not find it out , then must you pay toll of half of your cloth . "
the princess thought that it would be quite an easy thing to find out the boy 's name , so she agreed to the bargain , and , putting all the wool back into the bag , she gave it to him , and he swung it over his shoulder and departed . she ran to the door to see where he went , for she had made up her mind that she would follow him secretly to his home , and find out from the neighbours what his name was . but , to her great dismay , though she looked this way and that , he had vanished completely , and she began to wonder what she should do if the giant came back and found that she had allowed someone , whose name she did not even know , to carry off all the wool . and , as the afternoon wore on , and she could think of no way of finding out who the boy was , or where he came from , she felt that she had made a great mistake , and she began to grow very frightened .
just as the gloaming was beginning to fall a knock came at the door , and , when she opened it , she found an old woman standing outside , who begged for a night 's lodging . now , as i have told you , the princess was very kind - hearted , and she would fain have granted the poor old dame 's request , but she dared not , for she did not know what the giant would say . so she told the old woman that she could not take her in for the night , as she was only a servant , and not the mistress of the house ; but she made her sit down on a bench beside the door , and brought her out some bread and milk , and gave her some water to bathe her poor , tired feet . she was so bonnie , and gentle , and kind , and she looked so sorry when she told her that she would need to turn her away , that the old woman gave her her blessing , and told her not to vex herself , as it was a fine , dry night , and now that she had had a meal she could easily sit down somewhere and sleep in the shelter of the outhouses .
and , when she had finished her bread and milk , she went and laid down by the side of a green knowe , which rose out of the moor not very far from the byre door . and , strange to say , as she lay there she felt the earth beneath her getting warmer and warmer , until she was so hot that she was fain to crawl up the side of the hillock , in the hope of getting a mouthful of fresh air . and as she got near the top she heard a voice , which seemed to come from somewhere beneath her , saying , " tease , teasens , tease ; card , cardens , card ; spin , spinnens , spin ; for peerifool peerifool , peerifool is what men call me . " and when she got to the very top , she found that there was a crack in the earth , through which rays of light were coming ; and when she put her eye to the crack , what should she see down below her but a brilliantly lighted chamber , in which all the peerie folk were sitting in a circle , working away as hard as they could .
some of them were carding wool , some of them were combing it , some of them were spinning it , constantly wetting their fingers with their lips , in order to twist the yarn fine as they drew it from the distaff , and some of them were spinning the yarn into cloth . while round and round the circle , cracking a little whip , and urging them to work faster , was a yellow - haired peerie boy . " this is a strange thing , and these be queer on - goings , " said the old woman to herself , creeping hastily down to the bottom of the hillock again . " i must e'en go and tell the bonnie lassie in the house yonder . maybe the knowledge of what i have seen will stand her in good stead some day . when there be peerie folk about , it is well to be on one 's guard . "
so she went back to the house and told the princess all that she had seen and heard , and the princess was so delighted with what she had told her that she risked the giant 's wrath and allowed her to go and sleep in the hayloft . it was not very long after the old woman had gone to rest before the door opened , and the peerie boy appeared once more with a number of webs of cloth upon his shoulder . " here is your cloth , " he said , with a sly smile , " and i will put it on the shelf for thee the moment that you tell me what my name is . " then the princess , who was a merry maiden , thought that she would tease the little follow for a time ere she let him know that she had found out his secret .
so she mentioned first one name and then another , always pretending to think that she had hit upon the right one ; and all the time the peerie boy jumped from side to side with delight , for he thought that she would never find out the right name , and that half of the cloth would be his . but at last the princess grew tired of joking , and she cried out , with a little laugh of triumph , " do you by any chance know anyone called peerifool , little mannikin ? " then he knew that in some way she had found out what men called him , and he was so angry and disappointed that he flung the webs of cloth down in a heap on the floor , and ran out at the door , slamming it behind him . meanwhile the giant was coming down the hill in the darkening , and , to his astonishment , he met a troop of little peerie folk toiling up it , looking as if they were so tired that they could hardly get along . their eyes were dim and listless , their heads were hanging on their breasts , and their lips were so long and twisted that the poor little people looked quite hideous .
the giant asked how this was , and they told him that they had to work so hard all day , spinning for their master that they were quite exhausted ; and that the reason why their lips were so distorted was that they used them constantly to wet their fingers , so that they might pull the wool in very fine strands from the distaff . " i always thought a great deal of women who could spin , " said the giant , " and i looked out for a housewife that could do so . but after this i will be more careful , for the housewife that i have now is a bonnie little woman , and i would be loth to have her spoil her face in that manner . " and he hurried home in a great state of mind in case he should find that his new servant 's pretty red lips had grown long and ugly in his absence .
great was his relief to see her standing by the table , bonnie and winsome as ever , with all the webs of cloth in a pile in front of her . " by my truth , you are an industrious maiden , " he said , in high good humour , " and , as a reward for working so diligently , i will restore your sisters to you . " and he went out to the byre , and lifted the two other princesses down from the rafters , and brought them in and laid them on the settle . their little sister nearly screamed aloud when she saw how ill they looked and how bruised their backs were , but , like a prudent maiden , she held her tongue , and busied herself with applying a cooling ointment to their wounds , and binding them up , and by and by her sisters revived , and , after the giant had gone to bed , they told her all that had befallen them .
" i will be avenged on him for his cruelty , " said the little princess firmly ; and when she spoke like that her sisters knew that she meant what she said . so next morning , before the giant was up , she fetched his creel , and put her eldest sister into it , and covered her with all the fine silken hangings and tapestry that she could find , and on the top of all she put a handful of grass , and when the giant came downstairs she asked him , in her sweetest tone , if he would do her a favour . and the giant , who was very pleased with her because of the quantity of cloth which he thought she had spun , said that he would . " then carry that creelful of grass home to my mother 's cottage for her cow to eat , " said the princess . " this will help to make up for all the cabbages which you have stolen from her kailyard . "
and , wonderful to relate , the giant did as he was bid , and carried the creel to the cottage . next morning she put her second sister into another creel , and covered her with all the fine napery she could find in the house , and put an armful of grass on the top of it , and at her bidding the giant , who was really getting very fond of her , carried it also home to her mother . the next morning the little princess told him that she thought that she would go for a long walk after she had done her housework , and that she might not be in when he came home at night , but that she would have another creel of grass ready for him , if he would carry it to the cottage as he had done on the two previous evenings . he promised to do so ; then , as usual , he went out for the day .
in the afternoon the clever little maiden went through the house , gathering together all the lace , and silver , and jewellery that she could find , and brought them and placed them beside the creel . then she went out and cut an armful of grass , and brought it in and laid it beside them . then she crept into the creel herself , and pulled all the fine things in above her , and then she covered everything up with the grass , which was a very difficult thing to do , seeing she herself was at the bottom of the basket . then she lay quite still and waited . presently the giant came in , and , obedient to his promise , he lifted the creel and carried it off to the old queen 's cottage . no one seemed to be at home , so he set it down in the entry , and turned to go away . but the little princess had told her sisters what to do , and they had a great can of boiling water ready in one of the rooms upstairs , and when they heard his steps coming round that side of the house , they threw open the window and emptied it all over his head ; and that was the end of him .
