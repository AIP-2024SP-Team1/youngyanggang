in a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful - the open plain , with its free sunshine and winds and flowers , or the close wood , with its delicious twilight - walks and enamored haunts - there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old indian . although the country furnished an abundance of game , and whatever else a good heart could wish for , it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands . he made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power , for the purpose of killing them . the country had been once thickly peopled , but this mudjee monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices , that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness . the secret of his success lay in his great speed . he had the power to assume the shape of any four - footed creature , and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy , to run with him . he had a beaten path on which he ran , leading around a large lake , and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning - post was the same .
whoever failed as every one had , yielded up his life at this post ; and although he ran every day , no man was ever known to beat this evil genius ; for whenever he was pressed hard , he changed himself into a fox , wolf , deer , or other swift - footed animal , and was thus able to leave his competitor behind . the whole country was in dread of this same mudjee monedo , and yet the young men were constantly running with him ; for if they refused , he called them cowards , which was a reproach they could not bear . they would rather die than be called cowards . to keep up his sport , the manito made light of these deadly foot - matches , and instead of assuming a braggart air , and going about in a boastful way , with the blood of such as he had overcome , upon his hands , he adopted very pleasing manners , and visited the lodges around the country as any other sweet - tempered and harmless old indian might .
his secret object in these friendly visits was to learn whether the young boys were getting old enough to run with him ; he kept a very sharp eye upon their growth , and the day he thought them ready , he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing - ground . there was not a family in all that beautiful region which had not in this way been visited and thinned out ; and the manito had quite naturally come to be held in abhorrence by all the indian mothers in the country . it happened that there lived near him a poor widow woman , whose husband and seven sons he had made way with ; and she was now living with an only daughter , and a son of ten or twelve years old . this widow was very poor and feeble , and she suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts of the lodge , that she would have been glad to die , but for her daughter and her little son . the mudjee monedo had already visited her lodge to observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to be challenged to the race ; and so crafty in his approaches and so soft in his manners was the monedo , that the mother feared that he would yet decoy the son and make way with him as he had done with his father and his seven brothers , in spite of all her struggles to save him .
and yet she strove with all her might to strengthen her son in every good course . she taught him , as best she could , what was becoming for the wise hunter and the brave warrior . she remembered and set before him all that she could recall of the skill and the craft of his father and his brothers who were lost . the widow woman also instructed her daughter in whatever could make her useful as a wife ; and in the leisure - time of the lodge , she gave her lessons in the art of working with the quills of porcupine , and bestowed on her such other accomplishments as should make her an ornament and a blessing to her husband 's household . the daughter , minda by name , was kind and obedient to her mother , and never failed in her duty . their lodge stood high up on the banks of a lake , which gave them a wide prospect of country , embellished with groves and open fields , which waved with the blue light of their long grass , and made , at all hours of sun and moon , a cheerful scene to look upon . across this beautiful prairie , minda had one morning made her way to gather dry limbs for their fire ; for she disdained no labor of the lodge . and while enjoying the sweetness of the air and the green beauty of the woods , she strolled far away .
she had come to a bank , painted with flowers of every hue , and was reclining on its fragrant couch , when a bird , of red and deep - blue plumage softly blended , alighted on a branch near by , and began to pour forth its carol . it was a bird of strange character , such as she had never before seen . its first note was so delicious to the ear of minda , and it so pierced to her young heart , that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound . it seemed like the human voice , forbidden to speak , and uttering its language through this wild wood - chant with a mournful melody , as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible . the voice of the bird rose and fell , and circled round and round , but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes , they seemed ever to have their center where minda sat ; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird , that sat in his red and deep - blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank . the poor bird strove more and more with his voice , and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to minda 's ear , till at last she could not refrain from saying , " what aileth thee , sad bird ? "
as if he had but waited to be spoken to , the bird left his branch , and alighting upon the bank , smiled on minda , and , shaking his shining plumage , answered : " i am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage . i have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the indian girls , but none ever heeded my voice till you . will you be mine ? " he added , and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene , and fairly entranced the young minda , who sat silent , as if she feared to break the charm by speech . the bird , approaching nearer , asked her , if she loved him , to get her mother 's consent to their marriage . " i shall be free then , " said the bird , " and you shall know me as i am . " minda lingered , and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes , or filling each pause with gentle human discourse ; questioning her as to her home , her family , and the little incidents of her daily life . she returned to the lodge later than usual , but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her . she returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood ; and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure , and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage . this she could not , however , muster heart and courage to do .
at last the widow began herself to have a suspicion that her daughter 's heart was in the wood , from her long delays in returning , and the little success she had in gathering the fire - branches for which she went in search . in answer to her mother 's questions , minda revealed the truth , and made known her lover 's request . the mother , considering the lonely and destitute condition of her little household , gave her consent . the daughter , with light steps , hastened with the news to the wood . the bird lover of course heard it with delight , and fluttered through the air in happy circles , and poured forth a song of joy which thrilled minda to the heart . he said that he would come to the lodge at sunset , and immediately took wing , while minda hung fondly upon his flight , till he was lost far away in the blue sky . with the twilight the bird lover , whose name was monedowa , appeared at the door of the lodge , as a hunter , with a red plume and a mantle of blue upon his shoulders . he addressed the widow as his friend , and she directed him to sit down beside her daughter , and they were regarded as man and wife . early on the following morning , he asked for the bow and arrows of those who had been slain by the wicked manito , and went out a - hunting . as soon as he had got out of sight of the lodge , he changed himself into the wood - bird , as he had been before his marriage , and took his flight through the air .
although game was scarce in the neighborhood of the widow 's lodge , monedowa returned at evening , in his character of a hunter , with two deer . this was his daily practice , and the widow 's family never more lacked for food . it was noticed , however , that monedowa himself ate but little , and that of a peculiar kind of meat , flavored with berries , which , with other circumstances , convinced them that he was not as the indian people around him . in a few days his mother - in - law told him that the manito would come to pay them a visit , to see how the young man , her son , prospered . monedowa answered that he should on that day be absent . when the time arrived , he flew upon a tall tree , overlooking the lodge , and took his station there as the wicked manito passed in . the mudjee monedo cast sharp glances at the scaffolds so well laden with meat , and as soon as he had entered , he said , " why , who is it that is furnishing you with meat so plentifully ? " " no one , " she answered , " but my son ; he is just beginning to kill deer . " " no , no , " he retorted ; " some one is living with you . " " kaween , no indeed , " replied the widow ; " you are only making sport of my hapless condition . who do you think would come and trouble themselves about me ? " " very well , " answered the manito , " i will go ; but on such a day i will again visit you , and see who it is that furnishes the meat , and whether it is your son or not . "
he had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight , than the son - in - law made his appearance with two more deer . on being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito , " very well , " he said , " i will be at home the next time , to see him . " both the mother and the wife urged monedowa to be aware of the manito . they made known to him all of his cruel courses , and assured him that no man could escape from his power . " no matter , " said monedowa ; " if he invites me to the race - ground , i will not be backward . what follows , may teach him , my mother , to show pity on the vanquished , and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers . " when the day of the visit of the manito arrived , monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat , which he pointed out to her , together with two or three buds of the birch - tree , which he requested her to put in the pot . he directed also that the manito should be hospitably received , as if he had been just the kind - hearted old indian he professed to be . monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior , embellishing his visage with tints of red , to show that he was prepared for either war or peace .
as soon as the mudjee monedo arrived , he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before ; but he dissembled , as usual , and , with a gentle laugh , said to the widow , " did i not tell you that some one was staying with you , for i knew your son was too young to hunt . " the widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him , inasmuch as he was a manito , and must have known before he asked . the manito was very pleasant with monedowa , and after much other discourse , in a gentle - spoken voice , he invited him to the racing - ground , saying it was a manly amusement , that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors , and that he should himself be pleased to run with him . monedowa would have excused himself , saying that he knew nothing of running . " why , " replied the mudjee monedo , trembling in every limb as he spoke , " do n't you see how old i look , while you are young and full of life . we must at least run a little to amuse others . " " be it so , then , " replied monedowa . " i will oblige you . i will go in the morning . " pleased with his crafty success , the manito would have now taken his leave , but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality . the meal was immediately prepared . but one dish was used .
monedowa partook of it first , to show his guest that he need not fear , saying at the same time , " it is a feast , and as we seldom meet , we must eat all that is placed on the dish , as a mark of gratitude to the great spirit for permitting me to kill animals , and for the pleasure of seeing you , and partaking of it with you . " they ate and talked , on this and that , until they had nearly dispatched the meal , when the manito took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath . on setting it down he immediately turned his head and commenced coughing with great violence . the old body in which he had disguised himself was well - nigh shaken in pieces , for he had , as monedowa expected , swallowed a grain of the birch - bud , and this , which relished to himself as being of the bird nature , greatly distressed the old manito , who partook of the character of an animal , or four - footed thing . he was at last put to such confusion of face by his constant coughing , that he was enforced to leave , saying , or rather hiccoughing as he left the lodge , that he should look for the young man at the racing - ground in the morning . when the morning came , monedowa was early astir , oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and arms with red and blue , resembling the plumage in which he had first appeared to minda . upon his brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining tints .
by his invitation his wife , minda , the mother and her young son , attended monedowa to the manito 's racing - ground . the lodge of the manito stood upon a high ground , and near it stretched out a long row of other lodges , said to be possessed by wicked kindred of his , who shared in the spoils of his cruelty . as soon as the young hunter and his party approached , the inmates appeared at their lodge - doors and cried out : " we are visited . " at this cry , the mudjee monedo came forth and descended with his companions to the starting - post on the plain . from this the course could be seen , winding in a long girdle about the lake ; and as they were now all assembled , the old manito began to speak of the race , belted himself up and pointed to the post , which was an upright pillar of stone . " but before we start , " said the manito , " i wish it to be understood that when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " " very well - be it so , " answered monedowa . " we shall see whose head is to be dashed against the stone . " " we shall , " rejoined the mudjee monedo . " i am very old , but i shall try and make a run . " " very well , " again rejoined monedowa ; " i hope we shall both stand to our bargain . "
" good ! " said the old manito ; and he at the same time cast a sly glance at the young hunter , and rolled his eyes toward where stood the pillar of stone . " i am ready , " said monedowa . the starting shout was given , and they set off at high speed , the manito leading , and monedowa pressing closely after . as he closed upon him , the old manito began to show his power , and changing himself into a fox he passed the young hunter with ease , and went leisurely along . monedowa now , with a glance upward , took the shape of the strange bird of red and deep - blue plumage , and with one flight , lighting at some distance ahead of the manito , resumed his mortal shape . when the mudjee monedo espied his competitor before him , " whoa ! whoa ! " he exclaimed ; " this is strange ; " and he immediately changed himself into a wolf , and sped past monedowa . as he galloped by , monedowa heard a noise from his throat , and he knew that he was still in distress from the birch - bud which he had swallowed at his mother - in - law 's lodge . monedowa again took wing , and , shooting into the air , he descended suddenly with great swiftness , and took the path far ahead of the old manito . as he passed the wolf he whispered in his ear : " my friend , is this the extent of your speed ? "
the manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings , for , on looking ahead , he saw the young hunter in his own manly form , running along at leisure . the mudjee monedo , seeing the necessity of more speed , now passed monedowa in the shape of a deer . they were now far around the circle of the lake , and fast closing in upon the starting - post , when monedowa , putting on his red and blue plumage , glided along the air and alighted upon the track far in advance . to overtake him , the old manito assumed the shape of the buffalo ; and he pushed on with such long gallops that he was again the foremost on the course . the buffalo was the last change he could make , and it was in this form that he had most frequently conquered . the young hunter , once more a bird , in the act of passing the manito , saw his tongue lolling from his mouth with fatigue . " my friend , " said monedowa , " is this all your speed ? " the manito made no answer . monedowa had resumed his character of a hunter , and was within a run of the winning - post , when the wicked manito had nearly overtaken him .
" bakah ! bakah ! nejee ! " he called out to monedowa ; " stop , my friend , i wish to talk to you . " monedowa laughed aloud as he replied : " i will speak to you at the starting - post . when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " one more flight as the blue bird with red wings , and monedowa was so near to the goal that he could easily reach it in his mortal shape . shining in beauty , his face lighted up like the sky , with tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun , and the parti - colored plume on his brow waving in the wind . monedowa , cheered by a joyful shout from his own people , leaped to the post . the manito came on with fear in his face . " my friend , " he said , " spare my life ; " and then added , in a low voice , as if he would not that the others should hear it , " give me to live . " and he began to move off as if the request had been granted . " as you have done to others , " replied monedowa , " so shall it be done to you . " and seizing the wicked manito , he dashed him against the pillar of stone . his kindred , who were looking on in horror , raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land , whence they have never returned .
the widow 's family left the scene , and when they had all come out into the open fields , they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood , where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover . monedowa turning to her , said : " my mother , here we must part . your daughter and myself must now leave you . the good spirit , moved with pity , has allowed me to be your friend . i have done that for which i was sent . i am permitted to take with me the one whom i love . i have found your daughter ever kind , gentle and just . she shall be my companion . the blessing of the good spirit be ever with you . farewell , my mother - my brother , farewell . " while the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words , monedowa , and minda his wife , changed at the same moment , rose into the air , as beautiful birds , clothed in shining colors of red and blue .
they caroled together as they flew , and their songs were happy , and falling , falling , like clear drops , as they rose , and rose , and winged their way far upward , a delicious peace came into the mind of the poor widow woman , and she returned to her lodge deeply thankful at heart for all the goodness that had been shown to her by the master of life . from that day forth she never knew want , and her young son proved a comfort to her lodge , and the tuneful carol of monedowa and minda , as it fell from heaven , was a music always , go whither she would , sounding peace and joy in her ear .
