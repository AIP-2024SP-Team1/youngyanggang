there was once a little page - boy , who was in service in a stately castle . he was a very good - natured little fellow , and did his duties so willingly and well that everybody liked him , from the great earl whom he served every day on bended knee , to the fat old butler whose errands he ran . now the castle stood on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea , and although the walls at that side were very thick , in them there was a little postern door , which opened on to a narrow flight of steps that led down the face of the cliff to the sea shore , so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in the shimmering sea . on the other side of the castle were gardens and pleasure grounds , opening on to a long stretch of heather - covered moorland , which , at last , met a distant range of hills .
the little page - boy was very fond of going out on this moor when his work was done , for then he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees , and catching butterflies , and looking for birds ' nests when it was nesting time . and the old butler was very pleased that he should do so , for he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the open air . but before the boy went out the old man always gave him one warning . " now , mind my words , laddie , and keep far away from the fairy knowe , for the little folk are not to trust to . "
this knowe of which he spoke was a little green hillock , which stood on the moor not twenty yards from the garden gate , and folk said that it was the abode of fairies , who would punish any rash mortal who came too near them . and because of this the country people would walk a good half - mile out of their way , even in broad daylight , rather than run the risk of going too near the fairy knowe and bringing down the little folks ' displeasure upon them . and at night they would hardly cross the moor at all , for everyone knows that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands open , so that any luckless mortal who does not take care may find himself inside . now , the little page - boy was an adventurous wight , and instead of being frightened of the fairies , he was very anxious to see them , and to visit their abode , just to find out what it was like .
so one night , when everyone else was asleep , he crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps , and along the sea shore , and up on to the moor , and went straight to the fairy knowe . to his delight he found that what everyone said was true . the top of the knowe was tipped up , and from the opening that was thus made , rays of light came streaming out . his heart was beating fast with excitement , but , gathering his courage , he stooped down and slipped inside the knowe .
he found himself in a large room lit by numberless tiny candles , and there , seated round a polished table , were scores of the tiny folk , fairies , and elves , and gnomes , dressed in green , and yellow , and pink ; blue , and lilac , and scarlet ; in all the colours , in fact , that you can think of . he stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene in wonder , thinking how strange it was that there should be such a number of these tiny beings living their own lives all unknown to men , at such a little distance from them , when suddenly someone -- he could not tell who it was -- gave an order . " fetch the cup , " cried the owner of the unknown voice , and instantly two little fairy pages , dressed all in scarlet livery , darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under the weight of a most beautiful silver cup , richly embossed and lined inside with gold .
he placed it in the middle of the table , and , amid clapping of hands and shouts of joy , all the fairies began to drink out of it in turn . and the page could see , from where he stood , that no one poured wine into it , and yet it was always full , and that the wine that was in it was not always the same kind , but that each fairy , when he grasped its stem , wished for the wine that he loved best , and lo ! in a moment the cup was full of it . " twould be a fine thing if i could take that cup home with me , " thought the page . " no one will believe that i have been here except i have something to show for it . " so he bided his time , and watched .
presently the fairies noticed him , and , instead of being angry at his boldness in entering their abode , as he expected that they would be , they seemed very pleased to see him , and invited him to a seat at the table . but by and by they grew rude and insolent , and jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , telling him that they saw everything that went on at the castle , and making fun of the old butler , whom the page loved with all his heart . and they laughed at the food he ate , saying that it was only fit for animals ; and when any fresh dainty was set on the table by the scarlet - clad pages , they would push the dish across to him , saying : " taste it , for you will not have the chance of tasting such things at the castle . " at last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer ; besides , he knew that if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so . so he suddenly stood up , and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand . " i 'll drink to you all in water , " he cried , and instantly the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
he raised the cup to his lips , but he did not drink from it . with a sudden jerk he threw the water over the candles , and instantly the room was in darkness . then , clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms , he sprang to the opening of the knowe , through which he could see the stars glimmering clearly . he was just in time , for it fell to with a crash behind him ; and soon he was speeding along the wet , dew - spangled moor , with the whole troop of fairies at his heels . they were wild with rage , and from the shrill shouts of fury which they uttered , the page knew well that , if they overtook him , he need expect no mercy at their hands . and his heart began to sink , for , fleet of foot though he was , he was no match for the fairy folk , who gained on him steadily .
all seemed lost , when a mysterious voice sounded out of the darkness : " if you would gain the castle door , keep to the black stones on the shore . " it was the voice of some poor mortal , who , for some reason or other , had been taken prisoner by the fairies -- who were really very malicious little folk -- and who did not want a like fate to befall the adventurous page - boy ; but the little fellow did not know this . he had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands , where the waves had come over them , the fairies could not touch him , and this mysterious sentence brought the saying into his mind .
so he turned , and dashed panting down to the shore . his feet sank in the dry sand , his breath came in little gasps , and he felt as if he must give up the struggle ; but he persevered , and at last , just as the foremost fairies were about to lay hands on him , he jumped across the water - mark on to the firm , wet sand , from which the waves had just receded , and then he knew that he was safe . for the little folk could go no step further , but stood on the dry sand uttering cries of rage and disappointment , while the triumphant page - boy ran safely along the shore , his precious cup in his arms , and climbed lightly up the steps in the rock and disappeared through the postern . and for many years after , long after the little page - boy had grown up and become a stately butler , who trained other little page - boys to follow in his footsteps , the beautiful cup remained in the castle as a witness of his adventure .
