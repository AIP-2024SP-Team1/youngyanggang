once upon a time there was a king whose wife had died , but he had a daughter who was so good and so beautiful that no one could have been kinder or lovelier than she . the king mourned a long time for the queen , because he had loved her greatly ; but in the course of time he grew weary of his lonely life , and married again with the widow of another king , who also had a daughter ; but one who was just as ugly and evil as the other was handsome and kind . the step - mother and daughter were jealous of the king 's daughter , because she was so handsome ; yet so long as the king was at home , they did not dare harm her , for he was very fond of her . but after a time , the king began to war against another king , and went out to battle . then the queen thought she now could do as she wished , and she let the king 's daughter starve , and beat and pushed her about everywhere . at last everything else was too good for her , and she had to herd the cows . so she went out with the cows , and pastured them in the forest or on the hill . food she had little or none , and she grew pale and thin , and was sad most of the time , and wept . in the herd there was also a great blue bull , who always kept himself neat and clean , and often came to the king 's daughter and let her scratch him .
once , as she sat there and cried and was sad , he came to her again , and asked why she was so unhappy . she did not answer him but kept on weeping . " well , i know what your trouble is , " said the bull , " even though you will not tell me . you are weeping because the queen is so unkind to you , and would gladly starve you to death . but you need not worry about food , for in my left ear is a cloth and , if you will take it out and spread it , you can have as much as you want to eat . " she did so , took out the cloth , laid it on the grass , and it was at once covered with the finest dishes one might desire : bread and mead and honey - cake . then she soon regained her strength , and grew so plump , and so rose and white complexioned that the queen and her daughter , who was as thin as a rail , turned green and yellow with envy . the queen could not understand how it was that her step - daughter came to look so well in spite of such poor fare . so she told a maid to follow her to the forest , and watch and see how it came about ; for she thought some of the servants secretly gave her food . the maid followed her into the forest , and watched carefully , and saw how the step - daughter drew the cloth out of the blue bull 's left ear , and spread it out , and how it covered itself with the finest dishes , and also how the king 's daughter ate heartily . and the maid told the queen at home about it .
now the king came home , and he had defeated the other king , against whom he had warred ; and the whole castle was overjoyed , and none was more joyful than the king 's daughter . but the queen pretended to be ill , and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat . the king 's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do , and pleaded for the bull ; for all liked him , and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom . but no , he must be slaughtered , and he should be slaughtered , and there was no help for it . when the king 's daughter heard this , she felt sad , and went into the stable to the bull . he stood and hung his head , and looked so mournful that she could not keep from weeping . " why do you weep ? " asked the bull . then she told him that the king had come home , and that the queen had pretended to be ill , and had forced the physician to say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat , and that now he was to be slaughtered . " once she has done away with me , it will not be long before she does away with you , " said the bull . " but if it suits you , we will run away from here to - night . " the king 's daughter did say that it would be bad enough to leave her father , but that at the same time it would be worse to remain under the same roof with the queen , and so she promised the bull to go with him .
in the evening , while the rest were asleep , the king 's daughter crept down to the bull in the stable . he took her on his back , and ran off as quickly as ever he could . and when the people rose the following morning , and wanted to slaughter the bull , he was gone ; and when the king rose and asked for his daughter , she was gone as well . the king sent out messengers on all sides , and had the church - bells rung for her , but no one had seen anything of her .
in the meantime the bull trotted through many lands with the king 's daughter , and they came to a great copper forest , whose trees , leaves and flowers were all of copper . but before they entered it , the bull said to the king 's daughter : " now when we get into the forest you must be very careful not to touch so much as a single leaf , or else it is all up with you and with me ; for a troll with three heads lives here , and the forest belongs to him . " yes , indeed , she would be careful , and not touch anything . and she was very careful , and leaned to one side , and thrust aside the branches ; but the forest was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through , and for all that she was so careful , she did tear off a leaf , and it remained in her hand .
" alas , alas ! " cried the bull . " what have you done ! now i must fight for my very life . but see that you keep the leaf carefully ! " straightway they reached the end of the forest , and at once a troll with three heads came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " was the bull 's reply . " we 'll see if it is ! " shouted the troll . " that suits me ! " cried the bull . then they rushed at each other , and the bull gored and butted with might and main . but the troll was just as strong , and it took all day before the bull gained the upper hand . and then he had so many wounds , and was so weak that he could scarcely walk . so they had to halt for a whole day ; but the bull told the queen 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . thereupon he grew strong and well again , and they went on the next day . now they wandered for many , many days , and at last came to a silver forest , whose trees , branches , leaves , buds and all were of silver .
before the bull entered the forest he said to the king 's daughter : " now when we get into this forest , in heaven 's name be careful ! you must touch nothing , and not even tear off so much as a single leaf , or else it is all up with you and me . a troll with six heads lives here , and the forest belongs to him , and i will hardly be able to hold my own against him ! "
" yes , " said the king 's daughter , " indeed i will be careful , and not touch the least thing , just as you have told me . " but when they entered the forest , it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through . she was as careful as she could be , and avoided the branches , and thrust them aside with her hands ; but the branches struck her in the face each moment , and in spite of all her care a leaf did remain in her hand . " alas , alas ! " cried the bull . " what have you done ! now i must fight for my very life , for the troll with six heads is twice as strong as the first one ; but see that you take care of the leaf and keep it carefully ! "
at once the troll came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " oho , we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and rushed on the troll , gored him , and thrust his horns right through him . but the troll was just as strong , and it took three whole days before the bull got the better of him . after that he was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move , and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams . then he told the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . she did so , and he recovered again : yet they had to remain a time on the spot , until he was once more able to go on .
at last they set out again ; but the bull was still weak , and at first they went slowly . the king 's daughter wanted to spare him , and said she was young and quick on her feet , and could walk very well ; but this he would not allow , and she had to sit on his back . thus they wandered for a long time , and through many lands , and the king 's daughter had no idea where they might be going ; but at length they came to a golden forest . it was very beautiful , and the gold dripped down from it , for the trees , and branches and leaves and buds were all of purest gold . and here all went as it had in the copper and silver forests .
the bull told the king 's daughter that in no case was she to touch anything , since a troll with nine heads lived here , to whom the forest belonged . and he was much larger and stronger than the two others together , and he did not believe he could hold his own against him . yes , said she , she would be sure to pay attention and positively would not touch a thing . but when they entered the forest , it was even thicker than the silver forest , and the further they went the worse it became . the forest grew thicker and denser , and at last it seemed as though it would be impossible to push on at all . she was much afraid of tearing off anything , and wound and twisted and bent herself in every direction , in order to avoid the branches , and thrust them aside with her hands . but each moment they struck her in the face , so that she could not see where she was reaching , and before she had a chance to think , she held a golden apple in her hand . then she was terribly frightened , and began to cry , and wanted to throw it away . but the bull told her to keep it , and hide it carefully , and consoled her as best he could . yet he thought that the battle would be a hard one , and was in doubt as to whether it would end well .
but now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up , and he was so frightful that the king 's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him . " who has touched my forest ? " he shouted . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and with this they rushed on each other , so that it was a fearsome sight , and the king 's daughter nearly fainted . the bull gored the troll through and through with his horns ; but the troll was as strong as he , and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads , the others breathed fresh life into it , and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him . but then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit . his whole body was covered with wounds ; and he could not even tell the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll 's girdle and anoint him with the salve . but she did so of her own accord , and then he recovered again . yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks , until he was able to go on again .
at last they once more went slowly on their way ; for the bull said they still had a little further to go , and they went over many great hills and through thick forests . after a time they came to a rock . " do you see anything ? " asked the bull . " no , i see only the sky and the rock , " said the king 's daughter . but when they went on up the hills were more level , so that they had a broader outlook . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , i see a small castle , far , far in the distance , " said the princess . " and yet it is not so small , " said the bull . at length they came to a great mountain with a steep , rocky face . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , now i see the castle close by , and it is much , much larger , " said the king 's daughter . " that is where you must go ! " said the bull .
" just below the castle is a pig - sty , and if you go into it you will find a wooden coat . you must put it on , and go with it into the castle , and say your name is kari woodencoat , and ask for a place . but now take your little knife and cut off my head ; then draw off my skin , roll it up and lay it at the foot of the rock . but in it you must place the copper leaf , and the silver leaf , and the golden apple . outside , against the hill , is a stick , and if you want anything of me , all you need do is to knock at the mountain - side . " at first the princess could not at all make up her mind to do this ; but when the bull told her that this was the only reward he wanted for all the good he had done her , she could not refuse . it made her heart ache , yet in spite of it , she took her knife and cut until she had cut off the head of the great beast , and had drawn off his skin , and then she laid the latter at the foot of the rock , and in it she placed the copper leaf , and the silver leaf , and the golden apple .
when she had done this she went to the pig - sty , but she wept a great deal and felt sad . then she put on the wooden coat , and went to the king 's castle in it . she asked for a place in the kitchen , and said her name was kari woodencoat . yes , said the cook , she might have a place if she cared to wash up , for the girl who had formerly attended to it had run away . " and after you have been here a while , no doubt you will have enough of it , and run away from us , too , " said he . no , indeed , she would not do so .
she was most industrious at her washing up . on sunday they expected company at the king 's castle ; and kari asked permission to take up water to wash in to the prince . but the others laughed at her and cried ; " what do you want to do there ? do you think the prince will have anything to do with you , homely as you are ? " but she kept on asking , and at length received permission .
and then , as she ran up the stairs , her wooden coat clattered so loudly that the prince came out and asked : " and who are you ? " " i came to bring you water to wash in , " said kari . " do you think i want the water you are bringing me ? " cried the prince , and poured the water out over her head . so she had to go off ; but she asked permission to go to church . and she received permission , for the church was close by . but first she went to the rock and knocked at it with a stick , as the bull had told her . and a man came out at once and asked what she wanted . the king 's daughter said that she had permission to go to church and hear the sermon , but that she had no dress to wear . then the man gave her a dress that shone like the copper forest , and a horse and a saddle as well . when she came to church she looked so beautiful that all the people wondered who she might be , and none of them listened to the sermon , because they were all looking at her . she even pleased the prince so much that he could not keep from looking at her .
when she left the church , the prince came after her , and closed the church door behind her , and kept one of the gloves she wore in his hand . and then when she wanted to mount her horse , the prince came again , and asked her where she came from . " from washwaterland ! " said kari , and while the prince pulled out the glove and wanted to give it to her , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! " the prince had never yet seen such a handsome glove , and he traveled far , looking for the native land of the noble lady who had abandoned her glove , but no one could tell him where it might be .
the following sunday some one had to go up to the prince , and bring him a towel . " can not i go up ? " begged kari . " is that all you want ? " said the rest in the kitchen . " you saw yourself what happened to you the last time ! " but kari kept on asking , and finally she received permission , after all , and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat fairly clattered . the prince at once thrust his head out of the door , and when he saw that it was kari , he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her head . " off with you , you horrid creature ! " cried he . " do you think i want a towel that you have touched with your dirty fingers ? "
after that the prince went to church , and kari also begged permission to go . the people asked her why she wanted to go to church , since she had nothing to wear but her ugly , black wooden coat . but kari said the pastor preached so beautifully that she loved to listen to him , and finally they allowed her to go . she went to the wall of rock and knocked , and the man came out and gave her a dress that was far handsomer than the first ; it was embroidered all over with silver , and gleamed like the silver forest ; and she also received a splendid horse , with housings embroidered with silver , and a silver bridle . when the king 's daughter came to the church , the people were still standing before the church door . in their astonishment they all asked each other who she might be , and the prince came running up at once , and wanted to hold her horse while she dismounted . but she jumped right down , and said it would not be necessary , since the horse was so tame that it would stand still when she commanded , and come to her if she wished .
then every one went into the church . but hardly any one paid any attention to the sermon ; for they were all looking at kari , and the prince fell deeper in love with her than he had the first time . when the sermon was over , and she left the church and was about to mount her horse , the prince again came , and asked where she came from . " from towelland ! " said she , and let fall her riding - whip . and when the prince stooped to pick it up , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! "
off she was , and the prince did not know what had become of her . he wandered about in the world , far and wide , looking for her native land . but no one could tell him where it might be , and with that the prince finally had to content himself . the following sunday some one was to go up to the prince , and bring him a comb . kari begged that they would let her go , but the others reminded her of what had happened the last time , and scolded her for showing herself to the prince , ugly as she was , and in her wooden coat . but she kept on asking , and finally they let her go with the comb . when she once more came clattering up the stairs , the prince thrust his head out of the door , tore the comb from her hand , and shouted at her to be off . then the prince went to church , and kari wanted to go as well . the rest again asked her why she wanted to go to church , ugly as she was , since she did not even have clothes fit to appear in before other people . the prince , or some one else might happen to see her , and that would mean unhappiness for herself and others . but kari said that the people would have other things to look at besides herself , and finally they let her go .
then everything happened exactly as on the other two occasions . she went to the wall of rock , and knocked with the stick , and then the man came out , and gave her a dress that was far more beautiful than both of the others . it was all pure gold and diamonds , and she also received a beautiful horse , with housings embroidered with gold , and a golden bridle . when the king 's daughter came to the church , the pastor and all the congregation were still standing before the church door , waiting for her . the prince came running up at once , and wanted to hold her horse , but she jumped down and said : " no , thanks , it is not necessary , for my horse is so tame that he will remain standing when i tell him to do so . " so they all went into the church , and the pastor mounted the pulpit . but not a soul listened to the sermon , because all the people were looking at the princess , and wondering where she came from , and the prince fell still more deeply in love than he had on the two other occasions . he paid no attention to anything , and looked only at her .
when the sermon was over , and the king 's daughter left the church , the prince had poured tar on the floor of the vestibule , so that he might have a chance to help the king 's daughter across . but she paid no attention to it , stepped right into the middle of the tar , and leaped over . but one of her golden shoes stuck fast , and when she had mounted her horse , the prince came running out of the church and asked her whence she came . " from combland ! " she answered . but when the prince wanted to hand her the golden shoe , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! "
and again the prince did not know where she had gone , and he wandered about the world a long time , looking for combland ; but since no one could tell him where it might be , he let it be known that he would marry the girl whose foot the golden shoe fitted . then the handsome and the homely came scurrying up from the ends of the earth ; but none of them had a foot so small that they could put on the golden shoe . at last kari 's evil stepmother and her daughter also came , and the shoe fitted the latter . but she was very homely , and looked so unsatisfactory that the prince kept his promise most unwillingly . notwithstanding , preparations were made for the wedding , and she was adorned with her bridal finery , but when they rode to church , a little bird sat in a tree and sang : " a bit of the heel , and a bit of the toe , kari woodencoat 's shoe is filled with blood , i know ! "
and when they looked , the bird had told the truth , for blood was dripping from the shoe . then all the maids and all the women who were at the castle had to try on the shoe , but it would fit none of them . " but where is kari woodencoat ? " asked the prince , for he had understood the song of the bird , and remembered it well . " o she ! " said the others . " it is not worth while having her come , for she has feet like a horse . " " be that as it may , " said the prince . " but all the rest have tried it on , so she shall try it on as well . kari ! " he called out through the door , and kari came clattering up the stairs so that everything shook , just as though a whole regiment of dragoons had arrived . " now you shall try on the golden shoe , and be a princess ! " said the others , and made fun of her . but kari took the shoe , put her foot into it without a bit of trouble , cast off her wooden coat , and stood there in her golden dress , so that she was all a - sparkle , and on her other foot she had the golden shoe 's mate . the prince recognized her at once , put his arm around her , and kissed her . and she told him that she was a king 's daughter , which made him still more happy , and then they celebrated their wedding . " spin , span , spun , now our tale is done ! "
