once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess , but she could not marry anyone , because she was under an enchantment . so the king set out to seek a fairy , and asked what he could do to win the princess 's love . the fairy said to him : " you know that the princess has a great cat which she is very fond of . whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat 's tail is the man she is destined to marry . "
the king said to himself that this would not be very difficult , and he left the fairy , determined to grind the cat 's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all . you may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the princess , and puss , as usual , marched in before him , arching his back . the king took a long step , and quite thought he had the tail under his foot , but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air . and so it went on for eight days , till the king began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver - it was never still for a moment .
at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . " though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat . " if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . "
but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him . but after all , they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called hyacinth . the little prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas ! his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face . the queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose , but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked ; that it was a roman nose , and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose . the queen , who was devoted to her baby , was pleased with what they told her , and when she looked at hyacinth again , his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large .
the prince was brought up with great care ; and , as soon as he could speak , they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses . no one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own , and the courtiers , to get into favor with the queen , took to pulling their babies ' noses several times every day to make them grow long . but , do what they would , they were nothing by comparison with the prince 's .
when he grew sensible he learned history ; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of , his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses . his room was hung with pictures , all of people with very large noses ; and the prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty , that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter ! when his twentieth birthday was passed the queen thought it was time that he should be married , so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see , and among the others was a picture of the dear little princess !
now , she was the daughter of a great king , and would some day possess several kingdoms herself ; but prince hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort , he was so much struck with her beauty . the princess , whom he thought quite charming , had , however , a little saucy nose , which , in her face , was the prettiest thing possible , but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers , who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think ; but this did not do at all before the prince , who quite failed to see the joke , and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the dear little princess 's tiny nose !
the others , taking warning from this , learned to think twice before they spoke , and one even went so far as to tell the prince that , though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose , still , a woman 's beauty was a different thing ; and he knew a learned man who understood greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful cleopatra herself had a " tip - tilted " nose !
the prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news , and at once sent ambassadors to ask the dear little princess in marriage . the king , her father , gave his consent ; and prince hyacinth , who , in his anxiety to see the princess , had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when , to the horror of all who stood by , the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning , and , snatching up the dear little princess , whirled her away out of their sight !
the prince was left quite unconsolable , and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again , and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him , he mounted his horse and rode sadly away , letting the animal choose his own path . so it happened that he came presently to a great plain , across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house , and horse and rider were terribly hungry , when , as the night fell , the prince caught sight of a light , which seemed to shine from a cavern . he rode up to it , and saw a little old woman , who appeared to be at least a hundred years old . she put on her spectacles to look at prince hyacinth , but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short .
the prince and the fairy ( for that was who she was ) had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter , and cried at the same moment , " oh , what a funny nose ! " " not so funny as your own , " said prince hyacinth to the fairy ; " but , madam , i beg you to leave the consideration of our noses - such as they are - and to be good enough to give me something to eat , for i am starving , and so is my poor horse . " " with all my heart , " said the fairy . " though your nose is so ridiculous you are , nevertheless , the son of my best friend . i loved your father as if he had been my brother . now he had a very handsome nose ! " " and pray what does mine lack ? " said the prince . " oh ! it does n't lack anything , " replied the fairy . " on the contrary quite , there is only too much of it . but never mind , one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long . i was telling you that i was your father 's friend ; he often came to see me in the old times , and you must know that i was very pretty in those days ; at least , he used to say so . i should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time i ever saw him . " " indeed , " said the prince , " when i have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it ; but consider , madam , i beg of you , that i have had nothing to eat to - day . "
" the poor boy is right , " said the fairy ; " i was forgetting . come in , then , and i will give you some supper , and while you are eating i can tell you my story in a very few words - for i do n't like endless tales myself . too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose , and i remember when i was young that i was so much admired for not being a great chatterer . they used to tell the queen , my mother , that it was so . for though you see what i am now , i was the daughter of a great king . my father-- " " your father , i dare say , got something to eat when he was hungry ! " interrupted the prince . " oh ! certainly , " answered the fairy , " and you also shall have supper directly . i only just wanted to tell you-- " " but i really can not listen to anything until i have had something to eat , " cried the prince , who was getting quite angry ; but then , remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the fairy 's help , he added : " i know that in the pleasure of listening to you i should quite forget my own hunger ; but my horse , who can not hear you , must really be fed ! " the fairy was very much flattered by this compliment , and said , calling to her servants : " you shall not wait another minute , you are so polite , and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable . "
" plague take the old lady ! how she does go on about my nose ! " said the prince to himself . " one would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks ! if i were not so hungry i would soon have done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little ! how stupid people are not to see their own faults ! that comes of being a princess : she has been spoiled by flatterers , who have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker ! " meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table , and the prince was much amused to hear the fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak ; especially he noticed one maid who , no matter what was being said , always contrived to praise her mistress 's wisdom . " well ! " he thought , as he ate his supper , " i 'm very glad i came here . this just shows me how sensible i have been in never listening to flatterers . people of that sort praise us to our faces without shame , and hide our faults or change them into virtues . for my part i never will be taken in by them . i know my own defects , i hope . "
poor prince hyacinth ! he really believed what he said , and had n't an idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him , just as the fairy 's maid was laughing at her ; for the prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could do so without the fairy 's noticing her . however , he said nothing , and presently , when his hunger began to be appeased , the fairy said :
" my dear prince , might i beg you to move a little more that way , for your nose casts such a shadow that i really can not see what i have on my plate . ah ! thanks . now let us speak of your father . when i went to his court he was only a little boy , but that is forty years ago , and i have been in this desolate place ever since . tell me what goes on nowadays ; are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever ? in my time one saw them at parties , theatres , balls , and promenades every day . dear me ! what a long nose you have ! i can not get used to it ! " " really , madam , " said the prince , " i wish you would leave off mentioning my nose . it can not matter to you what it is like . i am quite satisfied with it , and have no wish to have it shorter . one must take what is given one . " " now you are angry with me , my poor hyacinth , " said the fairy , " and i assure you that i did n't mean to vex you ; on the contrary , i wished to do you a service . however , though i really can not help your nose being a shock to me , i will try not to say anything about it . i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose . to tell the truth , it would make three reasonable ones . "
the prince , who was no longer hungry , grew so impatient at the fairy 's continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away . but wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad , for they all talked of his nose , and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long , he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome .
the old fairy , who wished to make him happy , at last hit upon a plan . she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal , and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it . his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme , and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison ; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly . in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess , who , on her part , stretched out her hand that he might kiss it ; but turn which way he might , he never could raise it to his lips , for his long nose always prevented it . for the first time he realized how long it really was , and exclaimed : " well , it must be admitted that my nose is too long ! "
in an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters , and the old fairy , taking the dear little princess by the hand , said to the prince : " now , say if you are not very much obliged to me . much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose ! you would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it had n't hindered you from doing what you wanted to . you see how self - love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body . our reason tries in vain to show them to us ; we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests . " prince hyacinth , whose nose was now just like anyone 's else , did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received . he married the dear little princess , and they lived happily ever after .
