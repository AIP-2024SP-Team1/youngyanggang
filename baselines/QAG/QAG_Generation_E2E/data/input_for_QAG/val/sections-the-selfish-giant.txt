every afternoon , as they were coming from school , the children used to go and play in the giant 's garden . it was a large lovely garden , with soft green grass . here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars , and there were twelve peach - trees that in the spring - time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl , and in the autumn bore rich fruit . the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them . " how happy we are here ! " they cried to each other .
one day the giant came back . he had been to visit his friend the cornish ogre , and had stayed with him for seven years . after the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say , for his conversation was limited , and he determined to return to his own castle . when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden . " what are you doing here ? " he cried in a very gruff voice , and the children ran away . " my own garden is my own garden , " said the giant ; " any one can understand that , and i will allow nobody to play in it but myself . " so he built a high wall all round it , and put up a notice - board .
he was a very selfish giant . the poor children had now nowhere to play . they tried to play on the road , but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones , and they did not like it . they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over , and talk about the beautiful garden inside . " how happy we were there , " they said to each other . then the spring came , and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds . only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter . the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children , and the trees forgot to blossom . once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass , but when it saw the notice - board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again , and went off to sleep . the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost .
" spring has forgotten this garden , " they cried , " so we will live here all the year round . " the snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak , and the frost painted all the trees silver . then they invited the north wind to stay with them , and he came . he was wrapped in furs , and he roared all day about the garden , and blew the chimney - pots down . " this is a delightful spot , " he said , " we must ask the hail on a visit . " so the hail came . every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates , and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go . he was dressed in grey , and his breath was like ice . " i can not understand why the spring is so late in coming , " said the selfish giant , as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden ; " i hope there will be a change in the weather . "
but the spring never came , nor the summer.the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden , but to the giant 's garden she gave none . " he is too selfish , " she said . so it was always winter there , and the north wind , and the hail , and the frost , and the snow danced about through the trees . one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music . it sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the king 's musicians passing by . it was really only a little linnet singing outside his window , but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world . then the hail stopped dancing over his head , and the north wind ceased roaring , and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement . " i believe the spring has come at last , " said the giant ; and he jumped out of bed and looked out .
what did he see ? he saw a most wonderful sight . through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in , and they were sitting in the branches of the trees . in every tree that he could see there was a little child . and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms , and were waving their arms gently above the children 's heads . the birds were flying about and twittering with delight , and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing . it was a lovely scene , only in one corner it was still winter . it was the farthest corner of the garden , and in it was standing a little boy . he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree , and he was wandering all round it , crying bitterly . the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow , and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it .
" climb up ! little boy , " said the tree , and it bent its branches down as low as it could ; but the boy was too tiny . and the giant 's heart melted as he looked out . " how selfish i have been ! " he said ; " now i know why the spring would not come here . i will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree , and then i will knock down the wall , and my garden shall be the children 's playground for ever and ever . " he was really very sorry for what he had done . so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly , and went out into the garden . but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away , and the garden became winter again . only the little boy did not run , for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming . and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand , and put him up into the tree .
and the tree broke at once into blossom , and the birds came and sang on it , and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the giant 's neck , and kissed him . and the other children , when they saw that the giant was not wicked any longer , came running back , and with them came the spring . " it is your garden now , little children , " said the giant , and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall . and when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen . all day long they played , and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him good - bye . " but where is your little companion ? " he said : " the boy i put into the tree . " the giant loved him the best because he had kissed him . " we do n't know , " answered the children ; " he has gone away . "
" you must tell him to be sure and come here to - morrow , " said the giant . but the children said that they did not know where he lived , and had never seen him before ; and the giant felt very sad . every afternoon , when school was over , the children came and played with the giant . but the little boy whom the giant loved was never seen again . the giant was very kind to all the children , yet he longed for his first little friend , and often spoke of him . " how i would like to see him ! " he used to say . years went over , and the giant grew very old and feeble . he could not play about any more , so he sat in a huge armchair , and watched the children at their games , and admired his garden .
" i have many beautiful flowers , " he said ; " but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all . " one winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing . he did not hate the winter now , for he knew that it was merely the spring asleep , and that the flowers were resting . suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder , and looked and looked . it certainly was a marvellous sight . in the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms . its branches were all golden , and silver fruit hung down from them , and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved . downstairs ran the giant in great joy , and out into the garden . he hastened across the grass , and came near to the child . and when he came quite close his face grew red with anger , and he said , " who hath dared to wound thee ? "
for on the palms of the child 's hands were the prints of two nails , and the prints of two nails were on the little feet . " who hath dared to wound thee ? " cried the giant ; " tell me , that i may take my big sword and slay him . " " nay ! " answered the child ; " but these are the wounds of love . " " who art thou ? " said the giant , and a strange awe fell on him , and he knelt before the little child . and the child smiled on the giant , and said to him , " you let me play once in your garden , to - day you shall come with me to my garden , which is paradise . " and when the children ran in that afternoon , they found the giant lying dead under the tree , all covered with white blossoms .
