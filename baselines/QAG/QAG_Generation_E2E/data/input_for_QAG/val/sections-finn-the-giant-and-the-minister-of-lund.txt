there stands in the university town of schonen , the town of lund , the seat of the first archbishopric in all scandinavia , a stately romanic minster , with a large , handsome crypt beneath the choir . the opinion is universal that the minster will never be altogether finished , but that something will always be lacking about the structure . the reason is said to be as follows : when st . lawrence came to lund to preach the gospel , he wanted to build a church ; but did not know how he was to obtain the means to do so .
while he was cudgelling his brains about it , a giant came to him and offered to build the church on condition that st . lawrence tell him his name before the church was completed . but should st . lawrence be unable to do so , the giant was to receive either the sun , the moon or st . lawrence 's eyes . the saint agreed to his proposal .
the building of the church made rapid progress , and ere long it was nearly finished . st . lawrence thought ruefully about his prospects , for he did not know the giant 's name ; yet at the same time he did not relish losing his eyes . and it happened that while he was walking without the town , much concerned about the outcome of the affair , he grew weary , and sat down on a hill to rest . as he sat there he heard a child crying within the hill , and a woman 's voice began to sing : " sleep , sleep , my baby dear , to - morrow your father , finn , will be here ; then sun and moon you shall have from the skies to play with , or else st . lawrence 's eyes . "
when st . lawrence heard that he was happy ; for now he knew the giant 's name . he ran back quickly to town , and went to the church . there sat the giant on the roof , just about to set the last stone in place , when at that very moment the saint called out : " finn , finn , take care how you put the stone in ! "
then the giant flung the stone from him , full of rage , said that the church should never be finished , and with that he disappeared . since then something has always been missing from the church .
others say that the giant and his wife rushed down into the crypt in their rage , and each seizing a column were about to tear down the church , when they were turned into stone , and may be seen to this day standing beside the columns they had grasped .
