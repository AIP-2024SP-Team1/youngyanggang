once upon a time there was a man who went by the name of old dschang . he lived in the country , near yangdschou , as a gardener . his neighbor , named sir we , held an official position in yangdschou . sir we had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry , so he sent for a match - maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband . old dschang heard this , and was pleased . he prepared food and drink , entertained the match - maker , and told her to recommend him as a husband . but the old match - maker went off scolding .
the next day he invited her to dinner again and gave her money . then the old match - maker said : " you do not know what you wish ! why should a gentleman 's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself ? even though you had money to burn , your white hair would not match her black locks . such a marriage is out of the question ! " but old dschang did not cease to entreat her : " make an attempt , just one attempt , to mention me ! if they will not listen to you , then i must resign myself to my fate ! "
the old match - maker had taken his money , so she could not well refuse , and though she feared being scolded , she mentioned him to sir we . he grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house . " i knew you would not thank me , " said she , " but the old man urged it so that i could not refuse to mention his intention . " " tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade - stones , and four hundred ounces of yellow gold , then i will give him my daughter 's hand in marriage . "
but he only wished to mock the old man 's folly , for he knew that the latter could not give him anything of the kind . the match - maker went to old dschang and delivered the message . and he made no objection ; but at once brought the exact quantity of gold and jewels to sir we 's house . the latter was very much frightened and when his wife heard of it , she began to weep and wail loudly . but the girl encouraged her mother : " my father has given his word now and can not break it . i will know how to bear my fate . " so sir we 's daughter was married to old dschang . but even after the wedding the latter did not give up his work as a gardener . he spaded the field and sold vegetables as usual , and his wife had to fetch water and build the kitchen fire herself . but she did her work without false shame and , though her relatives reproached her , she continued to do so .
once an aristocratic relative visited sir we and said : " if you had really been poor , were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter ? why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener ? now that you have thrown her away , so to speak , it would be better if both of them left this part of the country . " then sir we prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and old dschang to visit him . when they had had sufficient to eat and drink he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind .
said old dschang : " i have only remained here because i thought you would long for your daughter . but since you are tired of us , i will be glad to go . i have a little country house back in the hills , and we will set out for it early to - morrow morning . " the following morning , at break of dawn , old dschang came with his wife to say farewell . sir we said : " should we long to see you at some later time , my son can make inquiries . " old dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear . he himself took his staff and walked after . a few years passed without any news from either of them . then sir we and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries . when the latter got back in the hills he met a plow - boy who was plowing with two yellow steers . he asked him : " where is old dschang 's country house ? " the plow - boy left the plow in the harrow , bowed and answered : " you have been a long time coming , sir ! the village is not far from here : i will show you the way . "
they crossed a hill . at the foot of the hill flowed a brook , and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill . gradually the landscape changed . from the top of the hill could be seen a valley , level in the middle , surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees , among which houses and towers peeped forth . this was the country house of old dschang . before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear , blue water . they passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate . here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion , and peacocks and cranes flew about . from the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments . crystal - clear tones rose to the clouds . a messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor . strange fragrances filled the air , and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl . two maid - servants came forth to greet him , followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional . after them a man in a flowing turban , clad in scarlet silk , with red slippers , came floating along . the guest saluted him . he was serious and dignified , and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh . at first we 's son did not recognize him , but when he looked more closely , why it was old dschang ! the latter said with a smile : " i am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming . your sister is just combing her hair . she will welcome you in a moment . " then he had him sit down and drink tea .
after a short time a maid - servant came and led him to the inner rooms , to his sister . the beams of her room were of sandalwood , the doors of tortoise - shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade ; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite . his sister was magnificently gowned , and far more beautiful than before . she asked him carelessly how he was getting along , and what her parents were doing ; but was not very cordial . after a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him . " my sister wishes to make an excursion to the mountain of the fairies , " said old dschang to him . " we will be back about sunset , and you can rest until we return . "
then many - colored clouds rose in the courtyard , and dulcet music sounded on the air . old dschang mounted a dragon , while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes . so they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction . they did not return until after sunset . old dschang and his wife then said to him : " this is an abode of the blessed . you can not remain here overlong . to - morrow we will escort you back . " on the following day , when taking leave , old dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat . " should you need money , " said he , " you can go to yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old wang 's drug - shop . there you can collect ten million pieces of copper . this hat is the order for them . " then he ordered his plow - boy to take him home again .
quite a few of the folks at home , to whom he described his adventures , thought that old dschang must be a holy man , while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision . after five or six years sir we 's money came to an end . so his son took the straw hat to yangdschou and there asked for old wang . the latter just happened to be standing in his drug - shop , mixing herbs . when the son explained his errand he said : " the money is ready . but is your hat genuine ? " and he took the hat and examined it . a young girl came from an inner room and said : " i wove the hat for old dschang myself . there must be a red thread in it . " and sure enough , there was . then old wang gave young we the ten million pieces of copper , and the latter now believed that old dschang was really a saint . so he once more went over the hills to look for him . he asked the forest - keepers , but they could tell him naught . sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old wang , but he had also disappeared .
when several years had passed he once more came to yangdschou , and was walking in the meadow before the city gate . there he met old dschang 's plow - boy . the latter cried out : " how are you ? how are you ? " and drew out ten pounds of gold , which he gave to him , saying : " my mistress told me to give you this . my master is this very moment drinking tea with old wang in the inn . " young we followed the plow - boy , intending to greet his brother - in - law . but when he reached the inn there was no one in sight . and when he turned around the plow - boy had disappeared as well . and since that time no one ever heard from old dschang again .
