in far bygone days , in the north , there lived a well - to - do farmer , who had seven sons and one daughter . and the youngest of these seven sons bore a very curious name ; for men called him assipattle , which means , " he who grovels among the ashes . " perhaps assipattle deserved his name , for he was rather a lazy boy , who never did any work on the farm as his brothers did , but ran about the doors with ragged clothes and unkempt hair , and whose mind was ever filled with wondrous stories of trolls and giants , elves and goblins . when the sun was hot in the long summer afternoons , when the bees droned drowsily and even the tiny insects seemed almost asleep , the boy was content to throw himself down on the ash - heap amongst the ashes , and lie there , lazily letting them run through his fingers , as one might play with sand on the sea - shore , basking in the sunshine and telling stories to himself .
and his brothers , working hard in the fields , would point to him with mocking fingers , and laugh , and say to each other how well the name suited him , and of how little use he was in the world . and when they came home from their work , they would push him about and tease him , and even his mother would make him sweep the floor , and draw water from the well , and fetch peats from the peat - stack , and do all the little odd jobs that nobody else would do . so poor assipattle had rather a hard life of it , and he would often have been very miserable had it not been for his sister , who loved him dearly , and who would listen quite patiently to all the stories that he had to tell ; who never laughed at him or told him that he was telling lies , as his brothers did .
but one day a very sad thing happened -- at least , it was a sad thing for poor assipattle . for it chanced that the king of these parts had one only daughter , the princess gemdelovely , whom he loved dearly , and to whom he denied nothing . and princess gemdelovely was in want of a waiting - maid , and as she had seen assipattle 's sister standing by the garden gate as she was riding by one day , and had taken a fancy to her , she asked her father if she might ask her to come and live at the castle and serve her . her father agreed at once , as he always did agree to any of her wishes ; and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer 's house to ask if his daughter would come to the castle to be the princess 's waiting - maid . and , of course , the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune which had befallen the girl , and so was her mother , and so were her six brothers , all except poor assipattle , who looked with wistful eyes after his sister as she rode away , proud of her new clothes and of the rivlins which her father had made her out of cowhide , which she was to wear in the palace when she waited on the princess , for at home she always ran barefoot .
time passed , and one day a rider rode in hot haste through the country bearing the most terrible tidings . for the evening before , some fishermen , out in their boats , had caught sight of the mester stoorworm , which , as everyone knows , was the largest , and the first , and the greatest of all sea - serpents . it was that beast which , in the good book , is called the leviathan , and if it had been measured in our day , its tail would have touched iceland , while its snout rested on the north cape . and the fishermen had noticed that this fearsome monster had its head turned towards the mainland , and that it opened its mouth and yawned horribly , as if to show that it was hungry , and that , if it were not fed , it would kill every living thing upon the land , both man and beast , bird and creeping thing . for it was well known that its breath was so poisonous that it consumed as with a burning fire everything that it lighted on . so that , if it pleased the awful creature to lift its head and put forth its breath , like noxious vapour , over the country , in a few weeks the fair land would be turned into a region of desolation .
as you may imagine , everyone was almost paralysed with terror at this awful calamity which threatened them ; and the king called a solemn meeting of all his counsellors , and asked them if they could devise any way of warding off the danger . and for three whole days they sat in council , these grave , bearded men , and many were the suggestions which were made , and many the words of wisdom which were spoken ; but , alas ! no one was wise enough to think of a way by which the mester stoorworm might be driven back . at last , at the end of the third day , when everyone had given up hope of finding a remedy , the door of the council chamber opened and the queen appeared .
now the queen was the king 's second wife , and she was not a favourite in the kingdom , for she was a proud , insolent woman , who did not behave kindly to her step - daughter , the princess gemdelovely , and who spent much more of her time in the company of a great sorcerer , whom everyone feared and dreaded , than she did in that of the king , her husband . so the sober counsellors looked at her disapprovingly as she came boldly into the council chamber and stood up beside the king 's chair of state , and , speaking in a loud , clear voice , addressed them thus : " ye think that ye are brave men and strong , oh , ye elders , and fit to be the protectors of the people . and so it may be , when it is mortals that ye are called on to face . but ye be no match for the foe that now threatens our land . before him your weapons be but as straw . it is not through strength of arm , but through sorcery , that he will be overcome . so listen to my words , even though they be but those of a woman , and take counsel with the great sorcerer , from whom nothing is hid , but who knoweth all the mysteries of the earth , and of the air , and of the sea . "
now the king and his counsellors liked not this advice , for they hated the sorcerer , who had , as they thought , too much influence with the queen ; but they were at their wits ' end , and knew not to whom to turn for help , so they were fain to do as she said and summon the wizard before them . and when he obeyed the summons and appeared in their midst , they liked him none the better for his looks . for he was long , and thin , and awesome , with a beard that came down to his knee , and hair that wrapped him about like a mantle , and his face was the colour of mortar , as if he had always lived in darkness , and had been afraid to look on the sun . but there was no help to be found in any other man , so they laid the case before him , and asked him what they should do . and he answered coldly that he would think over the matter , and come again to the assembly the following day and give them his advice . and his advice , when they heard it , was like to turn their hair white with horror .
for he said that the only way to satisfy the monster , and to make it spare the land , was to feed it every saturday with seven young maidens , who must be the fairest who could be found ; and if , after this remedy had been tried once or twice , it did not succeed in mollifying the stoorworm and inducing him to depart , there was but one other measure that he could suggest , but that was so horrible and dreadful that he would not rend their hearts by mentioning it in the meantime . and as , although they hated him , they feared him also , the council had e'en to abide by his words , and pronounced the awful doom . and so it came about that , every saturday , seven bonnie , innocent maidens were bound hand and foot and laid on a rock which ran into the sea , and the monster stretched out his long , jagged tongue , and swept them into his mouth ; while all the rest of the folk looked on from the top of a high hill -- or , at least , the men looked -- with cold , set faces , while the women hid theirs in their aprons and wept aloud .
" is there no other way , " they cried , " no other way than this , to save the land ? " but the men only groaned and shook their heads . " no other way , " they answered ; " no other way . " then suddenly a boy 's indignant voice rang out among the crowd . " is there no grown man who would fight that monster , and kill him , and save the lassies alive ? i would do it ; i am not feared for the mester stoorworm . " it was the boy assipattle who spoke , and everyone looked at him in amazement as he stood staring at the great sea - serpent , his fingers twitching with rage , and his great blue eyes glowing with pity and indignation .
" the poor bairn 's mad ; the sight hath turned his head , " they whispered one to another ; and they would have crowded round him to pet and comfort him , but his elder brother came and gave him a heavy clout on the side of his head . " thou fight the stoorworm ! " he cried contemptuously . " a likely story ! go home to thy ash - pit , and stop speaking havers ; " and , taking his arm , he drew him to the place where his other brothers were waiting , and they all went home together . but all the time assipattle kept on saying that he meant to kill the stoorworm ; and at last his brothers became so angry at what they thought was mere bragging , that they picked up stones and pelted him so hard with them that at last he took to his heels and ran away from them . that evening the six brothers were threshing corn in the barn , and assipattle , as usual , was lying among the ashes thinking his own thoughts , when his mother came out and bade him run and tell the others to come in for their supper .
the boy did as he was bid , for he was a willing enough little fellow ; but when he entered the barn his brothers , in revenge for his having run away from them in the afternoon , set on him and pulled him down , and piled so much straw on top of him that , had his father not come from the house to see what they were all waiting for , he would , of a surety , have been smothered . but when , at supper - time , his mother was quarrelling with the other lads for what they had done , and saying to them that it was only cowards who set on bairns littler and younger than themselves , assipattle looked up from the bicker of porridge which he was supping .
" vex not thyself , mother , " he said , " for i could have fought them all if i liked ; ay , and beaten them , too . " " why didst thou not essay it then ? " cried everybody at once . " because i knew that i would need all my strength when i go to fight the giant stoorworm , " replied assipattle gravely . and , as you may fancy , the others laughed louder than before .
time passed , and every saturday seven lassies were thrown to the stoorworm , until at last it was felt that this state of things could not be allowed to go on any longer ; for if it did , there would soon be no maidens at all left in the country . so the elders met once more , and , after long consultation , it was agreed that the sorcerer should be summoned , and asked what his other remedy was . " for , by our troth , " said they , " it can not be worse than that which we are practising now . " but , had they known it , the new remedy was even more dreadful than the old . for the cruel queen hated her step - daughter , gemdelovely , and the wicked sorcerer knew that she did , and that she would not be sorry to get rid of her , and , things being as they were , he thought that he saw a way to please the queen . so he stood up in the council , and , pretending to be very sorry , said that the only other thing that could be done was to give the princess gemdelovely to the stoorworm , then would it of a surety depart .
when they heard this sentence a terrible stillness fell upon the council , and everyone covered his face with his hands , for no man dare look at the king . but although his dear daughter was as the apple of his eye , he was a just and righteous monarch , and he felt that it was not right that other fathers should have been forced to part with their daughters , in order to try and save the country , if his child was to be spared . so , after he had had speech with the princess , he stood up before the elders , and declared , with trembling voice , that both he and she were ready to make the sacrifice . " she is my only child , " he said , " and the last of her race . yet it seemeth good to both of us that she should lay down her life , if by so doing she may save the land that she loves so well . "
salt tears ran down the faces of the great bearded men as they heard their king 's words , for they all knew how dear the princess gemdelovely was to him . but it was felt that what he said was wise and true , and that the thing was just and right ; for it were better , surely , that one maiden should die , even although she were of royal blood , than that bands of other maidens should go to their death week by week , and all to no purpose . so , amid heavy sobs , the aged lawman -- he who was the chief man of the council -- rose up to pronounce the princess 's doom . but , ere he did so , the king 's kemper -- or fighting - man -- stepped forward . " nature teaches us that it is fitting that each beast hath a tail , " he said ; " and this doom , which our lawman is about to pronounce , is in very sooth a venomous beast . and , if i had my way , the tail which it would bear after it is this , that if the mester stoorworm doth not depart , and that right speedily , after he have devoured the princess , the next thing that is offered to him be no tender young maiden , but that tough , lean old sorcerer . " and at his words there was such a great shout of approval that the wicked sorcerer seemed to shrink within himself , and his pale face grew paler than it was before .
now , three weeks were allowed between the time that the doom was pronounced upon the princess and the time that it was carried out , so that the king might send ambassadors to all the neighbouring kingdoms to issue proclamations that , if any champion would come forward who was able to drive away the stoorworm and save the princess , he should have her for his wife . and with her he should have the kingdom , as well as a very famous sword that was now in the king 's possession , but which had belonged to the great god odin , with which he had fought and vanquished all his foes . the sword bore the name of sickersnapper , and no man had any power against it . the news of all these things spread over the length and breadth of the land , and everyone mourned for the fate that was like to befall the princess gemdelovely . and the farmer , and his wife , and their six sons mourned also;--all but assipattle , who sat amongst the ashes and said nothing .
when the king 's proclamation was made known throughout the neighbouring kingdoms , there was a fine stir among all the young gallants , for it seemed but a little thing to slay a sea - monster ; and a beautiful wife , a fertile kingdom , and a trusty sword are not to be won every day . so six - and - thirty champions arrived at the king 's palace , each hoping to gain the prize . but the king sent them all out to look at the giant stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open , and when they saw it , twelve of them were seized with sudden illness , and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran , and never stopped till they reached their own countries ; and so only twelve returned to the king 's palace , and as for them , they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all . and none of them dare try to kill the stoorworm ; so the three weeks passed slowly by , until the night before the day on which the princess was to be sacrificed . on that night the king , feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests , made a great supper for them .
but , as you may think , it was a dreary feast , for everyone was thinking so much about the terrible thing that was to happen on the morrow , that no one could eat or drink . and when it was all over , and everybody had retired to rest , save the king and his old kemperman , the king returned to the great hall , and went slowly up to his chair of state , high up on the dais . it was not like the chairs of state that we know nowadays ; it was nothing but a massive kist , in which he kept all the things which he treasured most . the old monarch undid the iron bolts with trembling fingers , and lifted the lid , and took out the wondrous sword sickersnapper , which had belonged to the great god odin .
his trusty kemperman , who had stood by him in a hundred fights , watched him with pitying eyes . " why lift ye out the sword , " he said softly , " when thy fighting days are done ? right nobly hast thou fought thy battles in the past , oh , my lord ! when thine arm was strong and sure . but when folk 's years number four score and sixteen , as thine do , it is time to leave such work to other and younger men . " the old king turned on him angrily , with something of the old fire in his eyes . " wheest , " he cried , " else will i turn this sword on thee . dost thou think that i can see my only bairn devoured by a monster , and not lift a finger to try and save her when no other man will ? i tell thee -- and i will swear it with my two thumbs crossed on sickersnapper -- that both the sword and i will be destroyed before so much as one of her hairs be touched . so go , and thou love me , my old comrade , and order my boat to be ready , with the sail set and the prow pointed out to sea . i will go myself and fight the stoorworm ; and if i do not return , i will lay it on thee to guard my cherished daughter . peradventure , my life may redeem hers . "
now that night everybody at the farm went to bed betimes , for next morning the whole family was to set out early , to go to the top of the hill near the sea , to see the princess eaten by the stoorworm . all except assipattle , who was to be left at home to herd the geese . the lad was so vexed at this -- for he had great schemes in his head -- that he could not sleep . and as he lay tossing and tumbling about in his corner among the ashes , he heard his father and mother talking in the great box - bed . and , as he listened , he found that they were having an argument .
" tis such a long way to the hill overlooking the sea , i fear me i shall never walk it , " said his mother . " i think i had better bide at home . " " nay , " replied her husband , " that would be a bonny - like thing , when all the country - side is to be there . thou shalt ride behind me on my good mare go - swift . " " i do not care to trouble thee to take me behind thee , " said his wife , " for methinks thou dost not love me as thou wert wo nt to do . " " the woman 's havering , " cried the goodman of the house impatiently . " what makes thee think that i have ceased to love thee ? " " because thou wilt no longer tell me thy secrets , " answered his wife . " to go no further , think of this very horse , go - swift . for five long years i have been begging thee to tell me how it is that , when thou ridest her , she flies faster than the wind , while if any other man mount her , she hirples along like a broken - down nag . "
the goodman laughed . " twas not for lack of love , goodwife , " he said , " though it might be lack of trust . for women 's tongues wag but loosely ; and i did not want other folk to ken my secret . but since my silence hath vexed thy heart , i will e'en tell it thee . " " when i want go - swift to stand , i give her one clap on the left shoulder . when i would have her go like any other horse , i give her two claps on the right . but when i want her to fly like the wind , i whistle through the windpipe of a goose . and , as i never ken when i want her to gallop like that , i aye keep the bird 's thrapple in the left - hand pocket of my coat . " " so that is how thou managest the beast , " said the farmer 's wife , in a satisfied tone ; " and that is what becomes of all my goose thrapples . oh ! but thou art a clever fellow , goodman ; and now that i ken the way of it i may go to sleep . "
assipattle was not tumbling about in the ashes now ; he was sitting up in the darkness , with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes . his opportunity had come at last , and he knew it . he waited patiently till their heavy breathing told him that his parents were asleep ; then he crept over to where his father 's clothes were , and took the goose 's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat , and slipped noiselessly out of the house . once he was out of it , he ran like lightning to the stable . he saddled and bridled go - swift , and threw a halter round her neck , and led her to the stable door . the good mare , unaccustomed to her new groom , pranced , and reared , and plunged ; but assipattle , knowing his father 's secret , clapped her once on the left shoulder , and she stood as still as a stone . then he mounted her , and gave her two claps on the right shoulder , and the good horse trotted off briskly , giving a loud neigh as she did so .
the unwonted sound , ringing out in the stillness of the night , roused the household , and the goodman and his six sons came tumbling down the wooden stairs , shouting to one another in confusion that someone was stealing go - swift . the farmer was the first to reach the door ; and when he saw , in the starlight , the vanishing form of his favourite steed , he cried at the top of his voice : " stop thief , ho ! go - swift , whoa ! " and when go - swift heard that she pulled up in a moment . all seemed lost , for the farmer and his sons could run very fast indeed , and it seemed to assipattle , sitting motionless on go - swift 's back , that they would very soon make up on him . but , luckily , he remembered the goose 's thrapple , and he pulled it out of his pocket and whistled through it . in an instant the good mare bounded forward , swift as the wind , and was over the hill and out of reach of its pursuers before they had taken ten steps more .
day was dawning when the lad came within sight of the sea ; and there , in front of him , in the water , lay the enormous monster whom he had come so far to slay . anyone would have said that he was mad even to dream of making such an attempt , for he was but a slim , unarmed youth , and the mester stoorworm was so big that men said it would reach the fourth part round the world . and its tongue was jagged at the end like a fork , and with this fork it could sweep whatever it chose into its mouth , and devour it at its leisure . for all this , assipattle was not afraid , for he had the heart of a hero underneath his tattered garments . " i must be cautious , " he said to himself , " and do by my wits what i can not do by my strength . " he climbed down from his seat on go - swift 's back , and tethered the good steed to a tree , and walked on , looking well about him , till he came to a little cottage on the edge of a wood .
the door was not locked , so he entered , and found its occupant , an old woman , fast asleep in bed . he did not disturb her , but he took down an iron pot from the shelf , and examined it closely . " this will serve my purpose , " he said ; " and surely the old dame would not grudge it if she knew it was to save the princess 's life . " then he lifted a live peat from the smouldering fire , and went his way . down at the water 's edge he found the king 's boat lying , guarded by a single boatman , with its sails set and its prow turned in the direction of the mester stoorworm .
" it 's a cold morning , " said assipattle . " art thou not well - nigh frozen sitting there ? if thou wilt come on shore , and run about , and warm thyself , i will get into the boat and guard it till thou returnest . " " a likely story , " replied the man . " and what would the king say if he were to come , as i expect every moment he will do , and find me playing myself on the sand , and his good boat left to a smatchet like thee ? twould be as much as my head is worth . " " as thou wilt , " answered assipattle carelessly , beginning to search among the rocks . " in the meantime , i must be looking for a wheen mussels to roast for my breakfast . " and after he had gathered the mussels , he began to make a hole in the sand to put the live peat in . the boatman watched him curiously , for he , too , was beginning to feel hungry . presently the lad gave a wild shriek , and jumped high in the air . " gold , gold ! " he cried . " by the name of thor , who would have looked to find gold here ? "
this was too much for the boatman . forgetting all about his head and the king , he jumped out of the boat , and , pushing assipattle aside , began to scrape among the sand with all his might . while he was doing so , assipattle seized his pot , jumped into the boat , pushed her off , and was half a mile out to sea before the outwitted man , who , needless to say , could find no gold , noticed what he was about . and , of course , he was very angry , and the old king was more angry still when he came down to the shore , attended by his nobles and carrying the great sword sickersnapper , in the vain hope that he , poor feeble old man that he was , might be able in some way to defeat the monster and save his daughter . but to make such an attempt was beyond his power now that his boat was gone . so he could only stand on the shore , along with the fast assembling crowd of his subjects , and watch what would befall . and this was what befell !
assipattle , sailing slowly over the sea , and watching the mester stoorworm intently , noticed that the terrible monster yawned occasionally , as if longing for his weekly feast . and as it yawned a great flood of sea - water went down its throat , and came out again at its huge gills . so the brave lad took down his sail , and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the monster 's mouth , and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in , and , like jonah , went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body . on and on the boat floated ; but as it went the water grew less , pouring out of the stoorworm 's gills , till at last it stuck , as it were , on dry land . and assipattle jumped out , his pot in his hand , and began to explore . presently he came to the huge creature 's liver , and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil , he made a hole in it and put in the live peat .
woe 's me ! but there was a conflagration ! and assipattle just got back to his boat in time ; for the mester stoorworm , in its convulsions , threw the boat right out of its mouth again , and it was flung up , high and dry , on the bare land . the commotion in the sea was so terrible that the king and his daughter -- who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride , in white , ready to be thrown to the monster -- and all his courtiers , and all the country - folk , were fain to take refuge on the hill top , out of harm 's way , and stand and see what happened next . and this was what happened next .
the poor , distressed creature -- for it was now to be pitied , even although it was a great , cruel , awful mester stoorworm -- tossed itself to and fro , twisting and writhing . and as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out , and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it , into which the sea rushed . and that dent formed the crooked straits which now divide denmark from norway and sweden . then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea , and became the islands that we now call the orkney isles ; and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out , and they became what we now call the shetland isles . after that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died ; and this lump became the island of iceland ; and the fire which assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it , and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land .
when at last it was plainly seen that the mester stoorworm was dead , the king could scarce contain himself with joy . he put his arms round assipattle 's neck , and kissed him , and called him his son . and he took off his own royal mantle and put it on the lad , and girded his good sword sickersnapper round his waist . and he called his daughter , the princess gemdelovely , to him , and put her hand in his , and declared that when the right time came she should be his wife , and that he should be ruler over all the kingdom . then the whole company mounted their horses again , and assipattle rode on go - swift by the princess 's side ; and so they returned , with great joy , to the king 's palace . but as they were nearing the gate assipattle 's sister , she who was the princess 's maid , ran out to meet him , and signed to the princess to lout down , and whispered something in her ear .
the princess 's face grew dark , and she turned her horse 's head and rode back to where her father was , with his nobles . she told him the words that the maiden had spoken ; and when he heard them his face , too , grew as black as thunder . for the matter was this : the cruel queen , full of joy at the thought that she was to be rid , once for all , of her step - daughter , had been making love to the wicked sorcerer all the morning in the old king 's absence . " he shall be killed at once , " cried the monarch . " such behaviour can not be overlooked . " " thou wilt have much ado to find him , your majesty , " said the girl , " for it is more than an hour since he and the queen fled together on the fleetest horses that they could find in the stables . " " but i can find him , " cried assipattle ; and he went off like the wind on his good horse go - swift .
it was not long before he came within sight of the fugitives , and he drew his sword and shouted to them to stop . they heard the shout , and turned round , and they both laughed aloud in derision when they saw that it was only the boy who grovelled in the ashes who pursued them . " the insolent brat ! i will cut off his head for him ! i will teach him a lesson ! " cried the sorcerer ; and he rode boldly back to meet assipattle . for although he was no fighter , he knew that no ordinary weapon could harm his enchanted body ; therefore he was not afraid . but he did not count on assipattle having the sword of the great god odin , with which he had slain all his enemies ; and before this magic weapon he was powerless . and , at one thrust , the young lad ran it through his body as easily as if he had been any ordinary man , and he fell from his horse , dead .
then the courtiers of the king , who had also set off in pursuit , but whose steeds were less fleet of foot than go - swift , came up , and seized the bridle of the queen 's horse , and led it and its rider back to the palace . she was brought before the council , and judged , and condemned to be shut up in a high tower for the remainder of her life . which thing surely came to pass . as for assipattle , when the proper time came he was married to the princess gemdelovely , with great feasting and rejoicing . and when the old king died they ruled the kingdom for many a long year .
