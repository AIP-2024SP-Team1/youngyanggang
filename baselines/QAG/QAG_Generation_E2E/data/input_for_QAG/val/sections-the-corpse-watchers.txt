there was once a poor woman that had three daughters , and one day the eldest said , " mother , bake my cake and kill my cock till i go seek my fortune . " so she did , and when all was ready , says her mother to her , " which will you have -- half of these with my blessing , or the whole with my curse ? " " curse or no curse , " says she , " the whole is little enough . " so away she set , and if the mother did n't give her her curse , she did n't give her her blessing . she walked , and she walked , till she was tired and hungry , and then she sat down to take her dinner . while she was eating it a poor woman came up , and asked for a bit . " the dickens a bit you 'll get from me , " says she ; " it 's all too little for myself . " and the poor woman walked away very sorrowful . at nightfall she got lodging at a farmer 's , and the woman of the house told her that she 'd give her a spadeful of gold and a shovelful of silver if she 'd only sit up and watch her son 's corpse that was waking in the next room . she said she 'd do that , and so , when the family were in their bed , she sat by the fire , and cast an eye from time to time on the corpse that was lying under the table . all at once the dead man got up in his shroud , and stood before her , and said , " all alone , fair maid ? " she gave him no answer ; when he had said it the third time he struck her with a switch , and she became a grey flag .
about a week after , the second daughter went to seek her fortune , and she did n't care for her mother 's blessing no more nor her sister , and the very same thing happened to her . she was left a grey flag by the side of the other . at last the youngest went off in search of the other two , and she took care to carry her mother 's blessing with her . she shared her dinner with the poor woman on the road , and she told her that she would watch over her . well , she got lodging in the same place as the others , and agreed to mind the corpse . she sat up by the fire , with the dog and cat , and amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her . she thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse , he was so handsome .
but at last he got up , and , says he , " all alone , fair maid ? " and she was n't long about an answer : all alone i am not , i 've little dog douse , and pussy , my cat ; i 've apples to roast and nuts to crack , and all alone i am not . " ho , ho ! " says he , " you 're a girl of courage , though you would n't have enough to follow me . i am now going to cross the quaking bog , and go through the burning forest . i must then enter the cave of terror and climb the hill of glass , and drop from the top of it into the dead sea . " " i 'll follow you , " says she , " for i engaged to mind you . " he thought to prevent her , but she was stiff as he was stout .
out he sprang through the window , and she followed him , till they came to the " green hills , " and then says he : " open , open , green hills and let the light of the green hills through . " " aye , " says the girl , " and let the fair maid too . " they opened , and the man and woman passed through , and there they were on the edge of a bog . he trod lightly over the shaky bits of moss and sod ; and while she was thinking of how she 'd get across , the old beggar appeared to her , but much nicer dressed , touched her shoes with a stick , and the soles spread a foot on each side . so she easily got over the shaky marsh . the burning wood was at the edge of the bog , and there the good fairy flung a damp , thick cloak over her , and through the flames she went , and a hair of her head was not singed .
then they passed through the dark cavern of horrors , when she 'd have heard the most horrible yells , only that the fairy stopped her ears with wax . she saw frightful things , with blue vapours round them , and felt the sharp rocks and the slimy backs of frogs and snakes . when they got out of the cavern , they were at the mountain of glass ; and then the fairy made her slippers so sticky with a tap of her rod that she followed the young corpse quite easily to the top . there was the deep sea a quarter of a mile under them , and so the corpse said to her , " go home to my mother , and tell her how far you came to do her bidding . farewell ! " he sprung head - foremost down into the sea , and after him she plunged , without stopping a moment to think about it .
she was stupefied at first , but when they reached the waters she recovered her thoughts . after piercing down a great depth , they saw a green light towards the bottom . at last they were below the sea , that seemed a green sky above them ; and , sitting in a beautiful meadow , she half - asleep , and her head resting against his side . she could n't keep her eyes open , and she could n't tell how long she slept ; but when she woke , she was in bed at his house , and he and his mother sitting by her bedside , and watching her . it was a witch that had a spite to the young man because he would n't marry her , and so she got power to keep him in a state between life and death till a young woman would rescue him by doing what she had done . so , at her request , her sisters got their own shapes again , and were sent back to their mother , with their spades of gold and shovels of silver . maybe they were better after that , but i doubt it much . the youngest got the young gentleman for her husband . i 'm sure she lived happy , and , if they did n't live happy -- that we may !
