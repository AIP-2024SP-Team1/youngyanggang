long , long ago in japan there lived an old man and his wife . the old man was a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow , but his wife was a regular cross - patch , who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue . she was always grumbling about something from morning to night . the old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness . he was out most of the day at work in the fields , and as he had no child , for his amusement when he came home , he kept a tame sparrow . he loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child .
when he came back at night after his hard day 's work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow , to talk to her and to teach her little tricks , which she learned very quickly . the old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room , and they would play together . then when supper - time came , he always saved some tit - bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird .
now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest , and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes . the day before , she had made some starch , and now when she came to look for it , it was all gone ; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty . while she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch , down flew the pet sparrow , and bowing her little feathered head - a trick which she had been taught by her master - the pretty bird chirped and said : " it is i who have taken the starch . i thought it was some food put out for me in that basin , and i ate it all . if i have made a mistake i beg you to forgive me ! tweet , tweet , tweet ! "
you see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird , and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely . but not so . the old woman had never loved the sparrow , and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house , saying that it only made extra work for her . now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet . she scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior , and not content with using these harsh , unfeeling words , in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman , to show how sorry she was - and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird 's tongue .
" i suppose you took my starch with that tongue ! now you may see what it is like to go without it ! " and with these dreadful words she drove the bird away , not caring in the least what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering , so unkind was she ! the old woman , after she had driven the sparrow away , made some more rice - paste , grumbling all the time at the trouble , and after starching all her clothes , spread the things on boards to dry in the sun , instead of ironing them as they do in england .
in the evening the old man came home . as usual , on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him , ruffling out her feathers to show her joy , and at last coming to rest on his shoulder . but to - night the old man was very disappointed , for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen . he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals , and stepped on to the veranda . still no sparrow was to be seen . he now felt sure that his wife , in one of her cross tempers , had shut the sparrow up in its cage . so he called her and said anxiously : " where is suzume san ( miss sparrow ) today ? "
the old woman pretended not to know at first , and answered : " your sparrow ? i am sure i do n't know . now i come to think of it , i have n't seen her all the afternoon . i should n't wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting ! " but at last , when the old man gave her no peace , but asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet , she confessed all . she told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the rice - paste she had specially made for starching her clothes , and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done , in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue , and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again .
then the old woman showed her husband the sparrow 's tongue , saying : " here is the tongue i cut off ! horrid little bird , why did it eat all my starch ? " " how could you be so cruel ? oh ! how could you so cruel ? " was all that the old man could answer . he was too kind - hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife , but he was terribly distressed at what had happened to his poor little sparrow .
" what a dreadful misfortune for my poor suzume san to lose her tongue ! " he said to himself . " she wo n't be able to chirp any more , and surely the pain of the cutting of it out in that rough way must have made her ill ! is there nothing to be done ? " the old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep . while he wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe , a bright thought comforted him : he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow . having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last .
the next morning he rose early , as soon as ever the day broke , and snatching a hasty breakfast , started out over the hills and through the woods , stopping at every clump of bamboos to cry : " where , oh where does my tongue - cut sparrow stay ? where , oh where , does my tongue - cut sparrow stay ! "
he never stopped to rest for his noonday meal , and it was far on in the afternoon when he found himself near a large bamboo wood . bamboo groves are the favorite haunts of sparrows , and there sure enough at the edge of the wood he saw his own dear sparrow waiting to welcome him . he could hardly believe his eyes for joy , and ran forward quickly to greet her . she bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her , to show her pleasure at seeing her old friend again , and , wonderful to relate , she could talk as of old . the old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened , and inquired after her tongue , wondering how she could speak so well without it . then the sparrow opened her beak and showed him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one , and begged him not to think any more about the past , for she was quite well now . then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy , and no common bird . it would be difficult to exaggerate the old man 's rejoicing now . he forgot all his troubles , he forgot even how tired he was , for he had found his lost sparrow , and instead of being ill and without a tongue as he had feared and expected to find her , she was well and happy and with a new tongue , and without a sign of the ill - treatment she had received from his wife . and above all she was a fairy .
the sparrow asked him to follow her , and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove . the old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was . it was built of the whitest wood , the soft cream - colored mats which took the place of carpets were the finest he had ever seen , and the cushions that the sparrow brought out for him to sit on were made of the finest silk and crape . beautiful vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma of every room .
the sparrow led the old man to the place of honor , and then , taking her place at a humble distance , she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years . then the lady sparrow , as we will now call her , introduced all her family to the old man . this done , her daughters , robed in dainty crape gowns , brought in on beautiful old - fashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious foods , till the old man began to think he must be dreaming . in the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow 's daughters performed a wonderful dance , called the " suzume - odori " or the " sparrow 's dance , " to amuse the guest .
never had the old man enjoyed himself so much . the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot , with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him . but the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home . he thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment , and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife . he told the lady sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing . it was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her . now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart . if ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once .
the lady sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change , but the old man said he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at his not coming home at the usual time - and to his work , and there - fore , much as he wished to do so , he could not accept her kind invitation . but now that he knew where the lady sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time . when the lady sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer , she gave an order to some of her servants , and they at once brought in two boxes , one large and the other small . these were placed before the old man , and the lady sparrow asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present , which she wished to give him .
the old man could not refuse this kind proposal , and he chose the smaller box , saying : " i am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box . as you are so kind as to say that i may take whichever i like , i will choose the small one , which will be easier for me to carry . " then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding him good - by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time . thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily , the sparrow showing not the least ill - will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife . indeed , she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life .
when the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual , for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time . " where have you been all this time ? " she asked in a big voice . " why do you come back so late ? " the old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him , and then he told her of all that had happened to him , and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow 's house .
" now let us see what is in the box , " said the old man , not giving her time to grumble again . " you must help me open it . " and they both sat down before the box and opened it . to their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things . the mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again . the old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his . beyond his brightest expectations was the sparrow 's gift , which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
he said : " thanks to my good little sparrow ! thanks to my good little sparrow ! " many times . but the old woman , after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the gold and silver were over , could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature . she now began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents , for in the innocence of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows had offered him , preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home . " you silly old man , " said she , " why did you not bring the large box ? just think what we have lost . we might have had twice as much silver and gold as this . you are certainly an old fool ! " she screamed , and then went to bed as angry as she could be .
the old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box , but it was too late ; the greedy old woman , not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved , made up her mind , if possible , to get more . early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow 's house . when he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going , but it was useless . she would not listen to one word he said . it is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage . but her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else . it did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her - as , indeed , they were - and might punish her for what she had done .
ever since the lady sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found her , weeping and bleeding from the mouth , her whole family and relations had done little else but speak of the cruelty of the old woman . " how could she , " they asked each other , " inflict such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some rice - paste by mistake ? " they all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles , but the old woman they hated , and they determined , if ever they had the chance , to punish her as she deserved . they had not long to wait . after walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had made her husband carefully describe , and now she stood before it crying out : " where is the tongue - cut sparrow 's house ? where is the tongue - cut sparrow 's house ? "
at last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage . she hastened to the door and knocked loudly . when the servants told the lady sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see her , she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit , after all that had taken place , and she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house . the lady sparrow , however , was a polite bird , and so she went out to greet the old woman , remembering that she had once been her mistress .
the old woman intended , however , to waste no time in words , she went right to the point , without the least shame , and said : " you need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man . i have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind . i shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big box - that is all i want ! " the lady sparrow at once consented , and told her servants to bring out the big box . the old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back , and without even stopping to thank the lady sparrow began to hurry homewards .
the box was so heavy that she could not walk fast , much less run , as she would have liked to do , so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box , but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way . while she was staggering along under the heavy load , her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted . she could wait no longer , for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received .
at last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully , expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth . what she saw , however , so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses . as soon as she lifted the lid , a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her . not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much - coveted box contained . a demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her , monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her , a huge snake coiled and hissed about her , and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her . the old woman had never been so frightened in her life , and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her , glad to escape alive . when she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her , and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box .
then she began to blame the sparrow , but the old man stopped her at once , saying : " do n't blame the sparrow , it is your wickedness which has at last met with its reward . i only hope this may be a lesson to you in the future ! " the old woman said nothing more , and from that day she repented of her cross , unkind ways , and by degrees became a good old woman , so that her husband hardly knew her to be the same person , and they spent their last days together happily , free from want or care , spending carefully the treasure the old man had received from his pet , the tongue - cut sparrow .
