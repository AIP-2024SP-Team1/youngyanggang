once upon a time there was a scholar , who wandered away from his home and went to emmet village . there stood a house which was said to be haunted . yet it was beautifully situated and surrounded by a lovely garden . so the scholar hired it . one evening he was sitting over his books , when several hundred knights suddenly came galloping into the room . they were quite tiny , and their horses were about the size of flies . they had hunting falcons and dogs about as large as gnats and fleas . they came to his bed in the corner of the room , and there they held a great hunt , with bows and arrows : one could see it all quite plainly . they caught a tremendous quantity of birds and game , and all this game was no larger than little grains of rice .
when the hunt was over , in came a long procession with banners and standards . they wore swords at their side and bore spears in their hands , and came to a halt in the north - west corner of the room . they were followed by several hundred serving - men . these brought with them curtains and covers , tents and tent - poles , pots and kettles , cups and plates , tables and chairs . and after them some hundreds of other servants carried in all sorts of fine dishes , the best that land and water had to offer . and several hundred more ran to and fro without stopping , in order to guard the roads and carry messages .
the scholar gradually accustomed himself to the sight . although the men were so very small he could distinguish everything quite clearly . before long , a bright colored banner appeared . behind it rode a personage wearing a scarlet hat and garments of purple . he was surrounded by an escort of several thousands . before him went runners with whips and rods to clear the way .
then a man wearing an iron helmet and with a golden ax in his hand cried out in a loud voice : " his highness is graciously pleased to look at the fish in the purple lake ! " whereupon the one who wore the scarlet hat got down from his horse , and , followed by a retinue of several hundred men , approached the saucer which the scholar used for his writing - ink . tents were put up on the edge of the saucer and a banquet was prepared . a great number of guests sat down to the table . musicians and dancers stood ready . there was a bright confusion of mingled garments of purple and scarlet , crimson and green . pipes and flutes , fiddles and cymbals sounded , and the dancers moved in the dance . the music was very faint , and yet its melodies could be clearly distinguished . all that was said , too , the table - talk and orders , questions and calls , could be quite distinctly heard .
after three courses , he who wore the scarlet hat said : " quick ! make ready the nets and lines for fishing ! " and at once nets were thrown out into the saucer which held the water in which the scholar dipped his brush . and they caught hundreds of thousands of fishes . the one with the scarlet hat contented himself with casting a line in the shallow waters of the saucer , and caught a baker 's dozen of red carp .
then he ordered the head cook to cook the fish , and the most varied dishes were prepared with them . the odor of roasting fat and spices filled the whole room . and then the wearer of the scarlet hat in his arrogance , decided to amuse himself at the scholar 's expense . so he pointed to him and said : " i know nothing at all about the writings and customs of the saints and wise men , and still i am a king who is highly honored ! yonder scholar spends his whole life toiling over his books and yet he remains poor and gets nowhere . if he could make up his mind to serve me faithfully as one of my officials , i might allow him to partake of our meal . "
this angered the scholar , and he took his book and struck at them . and they all scattered , wriggling and crawling out of the door . he followed them and dug up the earth in the place where they had disappeared . and there he found an ants ' nest as large as a barrel , in which countless green ants were wriggling around . so he built a large fire and smoked them out .
